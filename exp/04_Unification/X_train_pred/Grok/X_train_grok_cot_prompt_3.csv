0,"Despite a notable decline in positive mental health at T2, the individual started with strong protective factors at T1 including high social support, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy, alongside low stress and general psychopathology, suggesting resilience. Additionally, reductions in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations at T2 further mitigate the risk of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as high general psychopathology and low life satisfaction, the significant improvements in positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction, and a substantial decrease in general psychopathology by T2 suggest that the person did not develop a new psychological disorder. The reduction in dysfunctional attitudes and overall distress further supports a trend toward recovery or stability rather than deterioration."
1,"Despite a strong baseline of positive mental health, self-efficacy, and social support at T1, the significant decline in protective factors like self-efficacy and life satisfaction, coupled with substantial increases in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations at T2, suggests the development of a psychological disorder. The rise in general psychopathology (GSI) further supports this conclusion."
0,"Despite some worsening in protective factors like social support and life satisfaction, and an increase in risk factors like dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology between T1 and T2, the individual already exhibited significant psychological distress at T1 with high general psychopathology (GSI), indicating a likely pre-existing disorder rather than a new onset."
0,"Despite some negative changes between T1 and T2, such as increased anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology, the individual started with a strong baseline of mental health at T1, characterized by high protective factors like self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support, which likely buffer against the development of a new psychological disorder. Additionally, the overall magnitude of negative changes does not appear severe enough to indicate the onset of a disorder given the robust initial psychological resilience."
0,"Despite a decline in protective factors like positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, the individual already exhibited significant psychological distress at T1, as indicated by high general psychopathology (GSI), anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes. The lack of a substantial increase in risk factors or psychopathology at T2 suggests no new disorder developed, as the individual was likely not healthy at T1."
1,"At T1, the individual showed relatively good mental health with low stress, low anxiety sensitivity, low fear of bodily sensations, and low general psychopathology, despite below-average positive mental health and self-efficacy; however, at T2, significant declines in protective factors like life satisfaction and social support, coupled with increases in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology, suggest the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some decline in protective factors like positive mental health and social support between T1 and T2, the individual started with a strong baseline of mental health, high self-efficacy, and low risk factors at T1, and the overall change in general psychopathology (GSI) shows improvement, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
1,"At T1, the individual showed a mixed profile with strong positive mental health and social support as protective factors, but also risk factors like low self-efficacy, elevated anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and slightly increased general psychopathology. By T2, significant declines in positive mental health, alongside increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and a substantial rise in general psychopathology, suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a significant decline in positive mental health at T2, the substantial improvements in social support and life satisfaction, along with a decrease in dysfunctional attitudes, suggest protective factors that likely mitigate the risk of developing a new psychological disorder. Additionally, the baseline at T1 shows strong positive mental health and self-efficacy, and the overall change in general psychopathology remains minimal, supporting the absence of a new disorder."
1,"Despite a strong baseline of positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy at T1, the significant decline in these protective factors by T2, coupled with an increase in dysfunctional attitudes, suggests the development of a psychological disorder. The reduction in general psychopathology does not outweigh the substantial loss of protective factors and the emergence of a key risk factor."
1,"At T1, the individual showed below-average positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, alongside low social support and coping skills, indicating vulnerability despite low stress and psychopathology. By T2, significant increases in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, combined with further declines in protective factors like positive mental health and social support, suggest the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual shows declines in protective factors like self-efficacy and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, the baseline mental health at T1 already indicated some risk factors (e.g., below-average positive mental health, above-average stress, and dysfunctional attitudes), and the overall change in general psychopathology (GSI) shows a decrease, suggesting no new disorder development."
0,"Although there are risk factors at T1 such as low social support, low self-efficacy, elevated stress, and dysfunctional attitudes, the overall psychological distress (GSI) remains relatively stable from T1 to T2 with a slight decrease, and the increase in self-efficacy as a protective factor suggests no new disorder development. The changes in other risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes are not substantial enough to indicate a new psychological disorder."
1,"Despite some improvements in positive mental health and self-efficacy from T1 to T2, the individual started with significant risk factors at T1 including low socioeconomic status, poor mental health, low social support, and high dysfunctional attitudes, and showed a substantial increase in fear of bodily sensations and general psychopathology at T2, indicating the likely development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some declines in protective factors like social support and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, the significant reduction in general psychopathology (GSI) and decreases in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes suggest that the person did not develop a new psychological disorder. The high initial distress at T1 likely indicates an existing condition rather than the onset of a new disorder at T2."
1,"Although the person was relatively healthy at T1 with low stress, high life satisfaction, and minimal anxiety or fear, the significant increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations by T2, coupled with a rise in dysfunctional attitudes and a sharp decline in social support, suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low positive mental health and self-efficacy at T1, the individual showed significant improvements in these protective factors by T2, alongside increased social support and reduced risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes. The overall trend indicates psychological improvement rather than the development of a new disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as high stress and low socioeconomic status, the significant improvement in protective factors like social support and self-efficacy, coupled with a substantial decrease in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, suggests that the person is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder. The decline in positive mental health is notable, but the overall trend indicates improved resilience and stability."
0,"Despite significant risk factors at T1, including high general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, the substantial improvements by T2—such as decreased psychopathology, reduced anxiety and fear, and increased self-efficacy and life satisfaction—suggest that the person did not develop a new psychological disorder. The positive changes in protective factors and reduction in risk factors indicate a trend toward recovery or stabilization rather than the onset of a new disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as low positive mental health, low social support, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, and high dysfunctional attitudes, the significant improvements in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) and reductions in risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity) by T2 suggest the person did not develop a new psychological disorder. The overall trend indicates a positive shift in mental health status between T1 and T2."
1,"At T1, the person exhibited mixed indicators with high stress and low self-efficacy as risk factors, despite average social support and high life satisfaction; by T2, a significant decline in life satisfaction, coupled with increases in anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, suggests the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although there are declines in protective factors like social support and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, the significant reduction in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, coupled with stable general self-efficacy and minimal increase in general psychopathology, suggests that the individual is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder. The baseline at T1 also shows a relatively balanced mental health profile despite some risk factors, supporting the absence of new disorder development."

0,"Despite some declines in protective factors like social support and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, the individual started with a relatively healthy baseline at T1, showing low levels of risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, and the changes in psychopathology (GSI) and other risk factors were not substantial enough to indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as low socioeconomic status, high stress, and low life satisfaction, the significant improvements in protective factors like social support and life satisfaction by T2, along with reductions in risk factors like fear of bodily sensations and dysfunctional attitudes, suggest that the person is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder. The overall trend indicates a positive trajectory in mental health between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite a significant decline in positive mental health between T1 and T2, the individual started with very high protective factors at T1 (strong positive mental health and self-efficacy) and showed improvements in life satisfaction and social support by T2, which likely buffer against the development of a new disorder. Additionally, the decrease in general psychopathology (GSI) and fear of bodily sensations, alongside only moderate increases in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, suggests no new psychological disorder emerged."
1,"At T1, the individual already showed vulnerabilities with low social support, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, and elevated stress, despite average or low risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes. By T2, significant declines in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction) and a strong increase in dysfunctional attitudes, alongside a slight rise in general psychopathology, suggest the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, the significant improvements in positive mental health and general self-efficacy, coupled with reductions in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations by T2, suggest that the individual is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder. The overall trend indicates a positive shift in mental health status, outweighing the slight increase in general psychopathology and decrease in social support."
1,"Although the individual showed some improvement in protective factors like self-efficacy and life satisfaction from T1 to T2, the significant worsening of positive mental health and the substantial increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology (GSI) suggest the development of a psychological disorder. The already elevated risk factors at T1, including high stress and anxiety sensitivity, further support this conclusion."
1,"Although the person was relatively stable at T1 with average mental health, low stress, and minimal anxiety-related concerns, the significant decline in positive mental health and social support by T2, coupled with an increase in general psychopathology (GSI), suggests the development of a psychological disorder. The reduction in protective factors and slight increase in risk factors like dysfunctional attitudes further support this conclusion."
0,"Despite low positive mental health and self-efficacy at T1, the significant improvements in these protective factors by T2, along with increased social support and minimal increases in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology, suggest the person is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder. The substantial decline in life satisfaction is concerning but appears counterbalanced by the positive changes in other key areas."
0,"Despite a notable decrease in life satisfaction and a slight increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology between T1 and T2, the individual started with a relatively healthy psychological profile at T1, including strong self-efficacy, good social support, and low stress, which likely buffered against the development of a new disorder. Additionally, positive changes in positive mental health and social support, along with a significant decrease in anxiety sensitivity, suggest resilience and no new psychological disorder at T2."
0,"At T1, the individual exhibited strong protective factors such as high general self-efficacy, above-average social support, and low stress, anxiety sensitivity, and general psychopathology, indicating good baseline mental health. Despite a notable decrease in self-efficacy and slight increases in dysfunctional attitudes between T1 and T2, the overall stability in other protective factors and minimal change in risk factors suggest no new psychological disorder developed."
1,"Although the person had some protective factors at T1 like high social support and average life satisfaction, the significant increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, alongside a decrease in self-efficacy and social support, suggests the development of a psychological disorder. Additionally, the high baseline fear of bodily sensations and above-average stress at T1, combined with demographic risk factors like low education and socioeconomic status, further support this prediction."
1,"Despite a strong baseline of mental health at T1 with high positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction, the significant decline in protective factors like life satisfaction and social support, coupled with a substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI) at T2, suggests the development of a psychological disorder. The increase in dysfunctional attitudes further supports this risk, outweighing the reductions in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and low socioeconomic status, the individual showed improvements in protective factors like positive mental health and social support by T2, with no significant worsening in general psychopathology. The overall trend suggests stability or slight improvement, indicating no new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite significant declines in protective factors like general self-efficacy and social support, and increases in risk factors like fear of bodily sensations and dysfunctional attitudes between T1 and T2, the individual already exhibited high levels of general psychopathology (GSI) and dysfunctional attitudes at T1, suggesting a pre-existing disorder rather than a new onset. Additionally, the improvement in positive mental health and reduction in GSI at T2 further indicate no new disorder development."
0,"Despite some negative changes between T1 and T2, such as decreased life satisfaction and self-efficacy, and slight increases in anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, the individual started with a very strong baseline of mental health at T1, including high protective factors like social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, and low risk factors like stress and psychopathology. These robust initial conditions likely buffer against the development of a new psychological disorder within the given timeframe."
0,"At T1, the individual exhibited strong protective factors such as high positive mental health, good social support, and life satisfaction, with minimal stress and low general psychopathology, despite slightly elevated anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations. Between T1 and T2, while there were minor declines in some protective factors like social support and life satisfaction, risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity decreased significantly, and general psychopathology also improved, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite significant risk factors at T1, including high stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology, the person likely already had a psychological disorder at T1, as indicated by the extremely elevated GSI score. The changes between T1 and T2 show mixed trends with some improvements and worsening factors, but do not clearly suggest the onset of a new disorder."
0,"Despite a notable decline in protective factors like life satisfaction and general self-efficacy between T1 and T2, the individual started with a strong baseline of mental health and social support at T1, and the reduction in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations suggests no new psychological disorder developed. The slight increase in general psychopathology remains within a non-clinical range, supporting a stable mental health status."
0,"Despite below-average demographic factors and initial mental health challenges at T1, including low self-efficacy, low social support, and elevated anxiety sensitivity, the significant improvements in protective factors like positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction by T2, alongside reductions in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, suggest the person likely did not develop a new psychological disorder. The increase in dysfunctional attitudes and slight rise in general psychopathology are concerning but appear outweighed by the positive changes."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, the overall trend from T1 to T2 shows improvement in key protective factors like positive mental health and reductions in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, suggesting the individual did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite high levels of anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology at T1, the significant decrease in GSI by T2 suggests a substantial reduction in overall psychological distress, indicating no new disorder development. Additionally, the improvement in positive mental health at T2 further supports a trend toward recovery or stability rather than deterioration."
0,"Despite some increases in risk factors like fear of bodily sensations and dysfunctional attitudes between T1 and T2, the individual started with a strong baseline of protective factors at T1 (high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, low stress and psychopathology) and shows minimal overall decline in mental health, with general psychopathology slightly improving. The changes do not suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite significant risk factors at T1, including high stress, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, the substantial improvements by T2 in protective factors like positive mental health, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy, along with a marked decrease in psychopathology (GSI), suggest that the person likely did not develop a new psychological disorder. The overall trend indicates recovery or stabilization rather than the onset of a new disorder."

The high initial psychopathology at T1 likely indicates an existing condition rather than a new onset at T2."
1,"Despite a relatively stable and average mental health profile at T1 with some protective factors like life satisfaction and social support, the significant decline in positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction by T2, coupled with an increase in anxiety sensitivity, suggests the development of a psychological disorder. The overall trend indicates a marked deterioration in key protective factors and an increase in risk factors over the 17-month period."
1,"Despite a relatively stable baseline at T1 with average mental health, low stress, and high life satisfaction, the significant increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, coupled with a notable decrease in positive mental health and an increase in dysfunctional attitudes, suggests the development of a psychological disorder. Additionally, low socioeconomic status and education as risk factors may have contributed to this vulnerability."
1,"Although the person had some protective factors at T1 like above-average education and socioeconomic status, and average positive mental health, the significant decline in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy) and substantial increase in risk factors (fear of bodily sensations and dysfunctional attitudes) between T1 and T2 suggest the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some declines in protective factors like social support and self-efficacy between T1 and T2, the individual was not psychologically healthy at T1 due to elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and stress, suggesting pre-existing concerns. The improvements in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, along with stable general psychopathology, indicate no new disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite a decline in protective factors like positive mental health and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, the individual started with a relatively healthy psychological profile at T1, with low risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, and showed no significant increase in psychopathology (GSI) at T2.

1,"Despite improvements in protective factors such as positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction, and reductions in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations from T1 to T2, the significant increase in general psychopathology (GSI) suggests the development of a new psychological disorder. The initial poor mental health state at T1, combined with the substantial rise in distress, outweighs the positive changes."
1,"At T1, the individual exhibited significant risk factors including very low positive mental health, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy, high stress, and extremely high dysfunctional attitudes, despite average general psychopathology. By T2, although life satisfaction and positive mental health improved, the substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI), anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations, coupled with a further decline in social support and self-efficacy, strongly suggests the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some increases in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations between T1 and T2, the individual started with a strong baseline of protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support) and showed further improvement in these areas at T2, alongside a significant decrease in dysfunctional attitudes and stable low psychopathology. This overall positive trajectory suggests no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Although there is a slight increase in general psychopathology and fear of bodily sensations from T1 to T2, the significant improvements in positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, along with a decrease in anxiety sensitivity, suggest a protective trend against developing a new psychological disorder. The baseline at T1 also indicates no severe distress or risk factors that would predispose the individual to a new disorder."
1,"Although the individual showed several protective factors at T1, such as high self-efficacy, good social support, and low general psychopathology, the significant increase in anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, coupled with a decrease in life satisfaction and self-efficacy by T2, suggests the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"At T1, the person exhibited significant risk factors including high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, despite average demographics and mixed protective factors like positive mental health but very low life satisfaction and social support. By T2, the worsening of key risk factors such as increased anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology, alongside a decline in life satisfaction and social support, strongly suggests the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as high stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology, the significant decrease in these risk factors by T2, along with a high socioeconomic status as a protective factor, suggests that the person did not develop a new psychological disorder. The decline in protective factors like positive mental health and life satisfaction is notable, but the overall reduction in distress and anxiety-related measures indicates stabilization or improvement rather than the onset of a new disorder."
1,"Although the person was psychologically healthy at T1 with strong protective factors like high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, the significant decline in these protective factors by T2, coupled with a substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI), suggests the development of a new psychological disorder. The rise in dysfunctional attitudes further supports this risk despite some stability in other risk factors like anxiety sensitivity."
0,"Despite a slight increase in general psychopathology and a decrease in social support between T1 and T2, the individual started with a strong baseline of mental health at T1, including high social support, good self-efficacy, and low risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, and showed improvements in positive mental health and life satisfaction by T2. These protective factors and positive changes likely mitigate the risk of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite significant declines in protective factors like general self-efficacy and social support, and an increase in general psychopathology between T1 and T2, the individual started with a very strong baseline of mental health at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and low distress) and showed improvement in positive mental health at T2, suggesting resilience against developing a new disorder."
1,"At T1, the individual showed below-average positive mental health and self-efficacy with very low coping skills, despite good social support and low stress or anxiety; however, by T2, significant declines in social support and life satisfaction, coupled with increases in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology, suggest the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some negative changes like decreased social support and life satisfaction, and a slight increase in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes at T2, the individual had significant protective factors at T1 (e.g., high self-efficacy, good life satisfaction) and notable reductions in key risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations) by T2, suggesting they likely did not develop a new psychological disorder."

The overall trend indicates recovery or stabilization rather than the onset of a new disorder."
0,"Despite significant stress and psychopathology at T1, the person shows improvement in several key areas by T2, including reduced anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology. These positive changes, alongside an increase in life satisfaction, suggest that a new psychological disorder is unlikely to have developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as high anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and stress, the significant improvements in these areas by T2, along with increased social support, suggest that the person is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder. The decrease in key risk factors and only a modest increase in general psychopathology further support this conclusion."
0,"Despite some declines in protective factors like general self-efficacy and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, the individual was psychologically healthy at T1 with strong positive mental health, high social support, and low general psychopathology, and the changes at T2 do not indicate significant increases in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity or dysfunctional attitudes. The overall profile suggests resilience and no clear evidence of a new psychological disorder developing."
0,"Despite a significant increase in dysfunctional attitudes between T1 and T2, the overall psychological profile shows improvement in protective factors like positive mental health and social support, alongside reductions in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations. Additionally, general psychopathology (GSI) remains low and stable, suggesting no new disorder development."
0,"Despite significant risk factors at T1, including high general psychopathology (GSI), anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, the individual shows improvement in several protective factors by T2, such as positive mental health and social support, with no substantial increase in psychopathology or risk factors. This suggests no new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite high stress and general psychopathology at T1, the individual had strong protective factors like positive mental health and social support, and by T2, key risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI significantly decreased, indicating improvement rather than the development of a new disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as low self-efficacy and below-average socioeconomic status, the overall mental health profile at T1 shows low distress and protective factors like adequate social support; the positive changes at T2, including improved self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction, along with decreased risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, suggest no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite significant risk factors at T1 including high stress, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, and high general psychopathology, the substantial improvements in protective factors like positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, along with reductions in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations by T2, suggest that the individual likely did not develop a new psychological disorder. The decrease in general psychopathology further supports a trajectory of recovery or stability rather than new onset."
0,"Although there are some risk factors such as a decrease in life satisfaction and an increase in anxiety sensitivity between T1 and T2, the overall protective factors like above-average socioeconomic status, improved self-efficacy, and a decrease in general psychopathology suggest the person is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some increases in risk factors like dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology from T1 to T2, the significant improvements in protective factors such as positive mental health, social support, and general self-efficacy, alongside an initially healthy baseline at T1 with low anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, suggest the person is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a slight increase in general psychopathology from T1 to T2, the individual started with strong protective factors at T1, including high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, and showed further improvement in life satisfaction and reductions in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes by T2. These positive trends and the absence of significant deterioration in mental health suggest that no new psychological disorder developed."
1,"Despite a strong baseline of positive mental health, social support, and low general psychopathology at T1, the significant decline in positive mental health and life satisfaction at T2, coupled with a notable increase in dysfunctional attitudes, suggests the development of a psychological disorder. The reduction in protective factors and rise in risk factors over time outweigh the initial strengths."
1,"Despite a strong positive mental health baseline at T1, the significant decline in protective factors like positive mental health and social support, coupled with a substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI) at T2, suggests the development of a psychological disorder.

0,"Despite a notable decline in positive mental health and some reduction in social support and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, the individual started with a strong baseline of mental health, high life satisfaction, and low stress at T1, and showed improvements in self-efficacy and reductions in anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes by T2. Overall, these changes do not suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and low self-efficacy, the overall trend from T1 to T2 shows improvement in key protective factors (increased self-efficacy and life satisfaction) and reduction in risk factors (decreased anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), suggesting the person did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite significant declines in protective factors like self-efficacy and social support between T1 and T2, the extremely high general psychopathology (GSI) at T1 suggests the person likely already had a psychological disorder at baseline, ruling out the development of a new disorder. Additionally, the substantial decrease in GSI at T2 indicates improvement rather than new onset."
0,"Although the person showed significant declines in protective factors like positive mental health and self-efficacy between T1 and T2, the substantial decrease in general psychopathology (GSI) and anxiety sensitivity suggests an overall improvement in mental health status, likely indicating no new disorder development. Additionally, despite high stress and low life satisfaction at T1, the baseline presence of significant psychopathology (high GSI) implies any issues may have been pre-existing rather than newly developed."

The overall trend indicates a positive shift in mental health status between T1 and T2."
1,"Although the individual showed relatively good mental health at T1 with high positive mental health, strong social support, and low dysfunctional attitudes, the significant decline in positive mental health, increase in anxiety sensitivity, and substantial rise in dysfunctional attitudes by T2 suggest the development of a psychological disorder. The decrease in general psychopathology (GSI) and fear of bodily sensations, alongside improved life satisfaction, are not sufficient to offset these risk factors."
1,"At T1, the individual showed risk factors such as low life satisfaction, high stress, high dysfunctional attitudes, and very high emotion-focused coping, despite some protective factors like low anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations; by T2, significant increases in general psychopathology (GSI), anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes indicate a likely development of a psychological disorder."
1,"Although the person was psychologically healthy at T1 with strong protective factors like high positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, the significant increases in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology by T2 suggest the development of a psychological disorder.

0,"Despite some increases in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes between T1 and T2, the overall improvement in protective factors such as positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction, alongside an initially low level of general psychopathology, suggests the person is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder. The significant decline in self-efficacy is concerning but does not outweigh the positive trends in other key areas."
0,"Although the person shows a significant decline in protective factors like positive mental health and social support between T1 and T2, the substantial reduction in general psychopathology (GSI) and a slight decrease in dysfunctional attitudes suggest an overall improvement in mental health, indicating no new disorder development. Additionally, despite high baseline distress at T1, the negative trends in key risk factors do not support the emergence of a new psychological disorder at T2."
1,"At T1, the person showed significant risk factors including high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, despite some protective factors like positive mental health and social support; by T2, the marked increase in general psychopathology, further elevation of anxiety-related measures, and decline in protective factors like social support and life satisfaction suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Although the person was relatively healthy at T1 with low levels of stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology, the significant decline in protective factors like social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, coupled with a substantial increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology (GSI) by T2, suggests the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"At T1, the individual showed relatively low psychological distress and stress, with protective factors like average social support and self-efficacy, but also vulnerabilities such as below-average positive mental health, life satisfaction, and coping skills, alongside elevated dysfunctional attitudes. By T2, significant increases in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology (GSI), coupled with a sharp decline in life satisfaction, suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, and elevated dysfunctional attitudes, the significant improvements by T2 in protective factors like social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, along with a decrease in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, suggest that the individual did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the person showed some risk factors at T1, such as high dysfunctional attitudes, elevated fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology, the improvements in positive mental health and reductions in dysfunctional attitudes and GSI by T2 suggest they did not develop a new psychological disorder. The overall trend indicates a stabilization or improvement in mental health despite declines in social support and self-efficacy."
0,"Despite significant stress and high general psychopathology at T1, the substantial decrease in GSI and improvements in positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction between T1 and T2 suggest recovery rather than the development of a new disorder. Additionally, reductions in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations further support a trend toward improved mental health."
0,"Although there are notable increases in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology between T1 and T2, the significant improvements in protective factors like positive mental health and social support, along with a decrease in dysfunctional attitudes, suggest resilience against developing a new psychological disorder. The baseline at T1 also indicates low overall distress despite some vulnerabilities, supporting the likelihood of remaining stable or improving."
1,"At T1, the person exhibited risk factors such as low self-efficacy, elevated stress, and heightened anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, despite average mental health and good socioeconomic status; by T2, a significant increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology (GSI) suggests the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as high stress, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, the individual shows significant improvement in protective factors like social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction by T2, alongside a slight decrease in overall psychopathology. These positive changes suggest that a new psychological disorder is unlikely to have developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some negative changes such as decreased social support and life satisfaction, and a slight increase in general psychopathology between T1 and T2, the overall profile does not strongly indicate the development of a new psychological disorder, as positive mental health significantly improved and key risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes did not worsen substantially."
0,"Despite a decline in some protective factors like self-efficacy and life satisfaction, and a slight increase in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes between T1 and T2, the individual's baseline at T1 shows strong mental health with low distress and high protective factors, suggesting resilience against developing a new psychological disorder. The overall changes, while notable, do not appear severe enough to indicate the onset of a disorder given the initial robust psychological state."
1,"Although the individual was relatively healthy at T1 with average to positive mental health indicators, good social support, and low risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, the drastic decline in life satisfaction by T2, coupled with a notable decrease in positive mental health and an increase in dysfunctional attitudes, suggests the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as low positive mental health and life satisfaction, and an increase in dysfunctional attitudes at T2, the overall improvement in positive mental health and life satisfaction, along with decreases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, suggests the person did not develop a new psychological disorder. The stable, near-average general psychopathology (GSI) further supports this conclusion."
1,"Despite a strong baseline of positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction at T1, the significant decline in protective factors like self-efficacy and life satisfaction, coupled with substantial increases in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology by T2, strongly suggests the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a significant decline in life satisfaction and a slight increase in general psychopathology between T1 and T2, the individual's strong baseline protective factors, such as high self-efficacy and low anxiety sensitivity at T1, combined with a notable decrease in dysfunctional attitudes by T2, suggest resilience against developing a new psychological disorder."
1,"Despite a strong baseline of mental health at T1 with high protective factors like social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, and low risk factors like stress and dysfunctional attitudes, the individual shows a concerning decline in positive mental health and an increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology by T2, suggesting the development of a psychological disorder. Additionally, demographic risk factors such as low education and socioeconomic status, combined with a decrease in social support, likely contribute to this vulnerability."
0,"Despite some increases in risk factors like general psychopathology and fear of bodily sensations between T1 and T2, the person's overall mental health improved with significant gains in positive mental health and life satisfaction, suggesting resilience against developing a new psychological disorder. Additionally, baseline T1 measures showed a relatively stable psychological state with low general psychopathology and protective factors like good self-efficacy and social support."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as low positive mental health and a slight increase in general psychopathology by T2, the overall trend shows significant improvements in protective factors like self-efficacy and life satisfaction, alongside substantial reductions in risk factors such as dysfunctional attitudes and fear of bodily sensations. These positive changes suggest that the person likely did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as high fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, and a notable decline in protective factors like social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction by T2, the significant reduction in fear of bodily sensations and general psychopathology suggests an overall improvement in key distress indicators. I believe the person likely had an ongoing issue at T1 that did not worsen into a new disorder by T2."
1,"At T1, the individual showed a mixed but generally stable mental health profile with high self-efficacy and life satisfaction as protective factors, despite low social support; however, by T2, significant declines in self-efficacy and life satisfaction, coupled with substantial increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"At T1, the person showed below-average positive mental health and self-efficacy, suggesting vulnerability, despite low levels of stress and psychopathology. By T2, significant increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, coupled with a sharp decline in social support, indicate the likely development of a psychological disorder."
1,"The individual was psychologically healthy at T1 with low distress and strong protective factors, but significant increases in risk factors like dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology at T2, alongside declines in well-being, indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"At T1, the person showed a mixed but generally stable mental health profile with low positive mental health but strong protective factors like high social support and self-efficacy, and low risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes. Between T1 and T2, there were further improvements in protective factors such as positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, alongside a decrease in general psychopathology, indicating no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"At T1, the individual showed a stable psychological profile with above-average protective factors like social support, self-efficacy, and coping skills, alongside low risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology. Between T1 and T2, there were positive changes in life satisfaction and social support, with decreases in dysfunctional attitudes and no significant increase in risk factors, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
1,"Although the person showed high positive mental health at T1, they had significant risk factors including low social support, low self-efficacy, high stress, elevated fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, which likely predisposed them to distress; by T2, a marked decline in positive mental health, coupled with increased anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, suggests the development of a psychological disorder despite some improvements in protective factors like social support and self-efficacy."
0,"Despite a significant decline in positive mental health from T1 to T2, the individual shows improvements in protective factors like general self-efficacy and social support, alongside reductions in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes. These positive changes, coupled with only a moderate increase in general psychopathology, suggest that a new psychological disorder likely did not develop between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as low positive mental health and self-efficacy, the significant improvements in these protective factors by T2, along with increased social support and decreased dysfunctional attitudes, suggest the person is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder. The overall trend indicates a positive shift in mental health status between T1 and T2."
1,"Despite some protective factors at T1 like high life satisfaction and positive mental health, the individual had significant risk factors including very high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, and by T2, a marked increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology (GSI) suggests the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1, such as high general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, and low protective factors like social support and self-efficacy, the overall trend from T1 to T2 shows improvement in key areas, including reduced general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, suggesting no new disorder developed."
0,"Despite lower socioeconomic status and some initial risk factors at T1 like below-average positive mental health and life satisfaction, the individual shows significant improvements in protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and a decrease in general psychopathology at T2. Additionally, the reduction in dysfunctional attitudes and stable social support suggest a lower likelihood of developing a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"Although the person had protective factors at T1 such as high social support and life satisfaction, the significant decrease in life satisfaction, increase in fear of bodily sensations, and substantial rise in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology by T2 suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a decrease in general self-efficacy and a slight increase in general psychopathology between T1 and T2, the individual started with a strong baseline of protective factors at T1 (high social support, self-efficacy, and low stress) and showed improvements in positive mental health and life satisfaction by T2, suggesting resilience against developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some negative changes between T1 and T2, such as decreased social support and life satisfaction, and increased fear of bodily sensations and dysfunctional attitudes, the individual started with a strong baseline of mental health at T1, including low stress, low general psychopathology, and high life satisfaction. These protective factors, combined with only modest increases in risk factors, suggest that a new psychological disorder is unlikely to have developed by T2."
1,"Despite some protective factors at T1 such as above-average positive mental health, the individual exhibited significant risk factors including high stress, high general psychopathology (GSI), elevated fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, which, combined with a substantial increase in GSI from T1 to T2, strongly suggests the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low positive mental health at T1, the individual exhibited strong protective factors such as high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with low levels of risk factors like anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology. Between T1 and T2, improvements in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and further reductions in risk factors suggest no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as low positive mental health, very low self-efficacy, and high dysfunctional attitudes, the significant improvements in social support and self-efficacy by T2, along with a decrease in dysfunctional attitudes and stable general psychopathology, suggest that the person is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some worsening indicators like increased dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology between T1 and T2, the significant improvements in positive mental health and life satisfaction, alongside initially low levels of stress and anxiety sensitivity at T1, suggest resilience and no new psychological disorder development."
1,"At T1, the individual showed a mixed profile with strong protective factors like high self-efficacy and social support, and low risk factors like minimal anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, despite low positive mental health; however, by T2, significant declines in protective factors (self-efficacy and life satisfaction) and marked increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI) suggest the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite an increase in general psychopathology and some risk factors like fear of bodily sensations and dysfunctional attitudes between T1 and T2, the overall improvement in protective factors such as positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction suggests resilience and a reduced likelihood of developing a new psychological disorder. Additionally, the baseline at T1 indicates low psychological distress and average to positive coping mechanisms, further supporting stability."
1,"At T1, the person exhibited several risk factors including high stress, elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, alongside low protective factors like poor self-efficacy and life satisfaction, despite average demographics. By T2, the significant decline in positive mental health and increase in general psychopathology, despite some improvements in self-efficacy and social support, suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."

These positive changes suggest the person is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some initial risk factors at T1 such as low positive mental health and social support, the significant improvements in protective factors (e.g., increased social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and reductions in risk factors (e.g., decreased anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes) between T1 and T2 suggest that the person is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder. The overall trend indicates improved mental health and resilience."
0,"Despite some increases in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations between T1 and T2, the individual's strong protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy) and improvements in life satisfaction and self-efficacy at T2, along with decreased dysfunctional attitudes and stable low general psychopathology, suggest they are unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there are risk factors at T1 such as high anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, along with further increases in GSI from T1 to T2, the individual likely already had a psychological disorder at T1, indicating no new onset between time points. The lack of significant worsening in most key risk factors and an improvement in life satisfaction further support that no new disorder developed."
0,"Although there are declines in protective factors like life satisfaction and social support between T1 and T2, the individual starts with a strong baseline of mental health at T1, including high life satisfaction, strong social support, and low levels of stress and psychopathology. The changes in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations are minimal, and the overall profile does not suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as low positive mental health and general self-efficacy, the overall profile at T1 shows low psychological distress (GSI), and the changes from T1 to T2 indicate improvements in protective factors like positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with minimal increases in risk factors.
