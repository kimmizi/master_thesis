0.0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as low positive mental health, elevated anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations, the overall trend from T1 to T2 shows improvement in key protective factors like positive mental health and reductions in anxiety-related measures, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
1.0,"Despite a strong baseline of positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy at T1, the significant decline in these protective factors, coupled with a substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and heightened anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations at T2, suggests the development of a new psychological disorder. The notable decrease in socioeconomic status as a risk factor further supports this prediction."
0.0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, the overall improvement in protective factors like positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, along with reductions in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations by T2, suggest the person did not develop a new psychological disorder. The significant decrease in life satisfaction is notable but appears insufficient to indicate a new disorder given the other positive changes and low general psychopathology."
0.0,"Despite high levels of anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology at T1, the significant improvements in these risk factors by T2, along with a substantial increase in general self-efficacy, suggest that the person likely did not develop a new psychological disorder. The decreases in social support and life satisfaction are concerning but appear to be outweighed by the overall reduction in distress and risk factors."
0.0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as high anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and low self-efficacy, the overall trend from T1 to T2 shows a decrease in key risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology, alongside an increase in self-efficacy, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
1.0,"Despite a relatively healthy baseline at T1 with above-average positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, the individual shows significant increases in risk factors by T2, including a substantial rise in fear of bodily sensations and general psychopathology (GSI). These changes, alongside declines in protective factors like positive mental health and self-efficacy, suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0.0,"At T1, the individual showed a relatively healthy psychological profile with above-average self-efficacy, life satisfaction, problem-focused coping, and low stress, anxiety sensitivity, and general psychopathology, despite below-average positive mental health. Between T1 and T2, while life satisfaction decreased and anxiety sensitivity slightly increased, protective factors like self-efficacy improved, dysfunctional attitudes decreased, and overall psychopathology remained low, suggesting no new disorder development."
0.0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as low positive mental health and social support, the individual showed significant improvement in these protective factors by T2, alongside a decrease in general psychopathology, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed. Additionally, while life satisfaction decreased, the overall trend of reduced distress and stable or improved mental health indicators supports a stable or improving condition."
0.0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 such as low socioeconomic status, low self-efficacy, and high dysfunctional attitudes, the significant improvements by T2 in protective factors like self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support, along with a substantial decrease in dysfunctional attitudes and stable low general psychopathology, suggest the person did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0.0,"Despite a decline in positive mental health and life satisfaction from T1 to T2, the individual already exhibited significant psychological distress at T1 with high general psychopathology (GSI) and low self-efficacy, suggesting an existing condition rather than a new disorder. Additionally, improvements in self-efficacy and reductions in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes between T1 and T2 indicate a potential stabilization or improvement, not a new onset."
1.0,"Despite an average demographic profile and some protective factors at T1 such as low stress and dysfunctional attitudes, the individual showed significant risk factors at T1 including high anxiety sensitivity, high fear of bodily sensations, and very low self-efficacy, which, combined with a substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and worsening of life satisfaction, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations at T2, suggests the development of a psychological disorder."
1.0,"Despite a relatively stable baseline at T1 with high life satisfaction and social support, the significant increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, coupled with a decrease in protective factors like social support and life satisfaction, suggests the development of a new psychological disorder."
0.0,"Despite some risk factors at T1, such as high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, the significant improvements by T2 in these areas, along with increases in positive mental health and life satisfaction, suggest that the person did not develop a new psychological disorder. The overall trend indicates recovery or stabilization rather than the onset of a new disorder."
1.0,"Although the individual was relatively healthy at T1 with strong social support, good self-efficacy, and low levels of stress and psychopathology, the significant increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology by T2, coupled with a substantial decrease in social support, suggest the development of a psychological disorder."
1.0,"Although the person was relatively healthy at T1 with high positive mental health and self-efficacy, and despite improvements in social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction at T2, the significant increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, coupled with a sharp decline in positive mental health, suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0.0,"At T1, the person showed mixed mental health indicators with low life satisfaction and higher stress as risk factors, but also protective factors like good social support and low dysfunctional attitudes; by T2, despite a slight increase in anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, overall psychopathology (GSI) decreased significantly, and protective factors like self-efficacy and life satisfaction improved, suggesting no new disorder developed."
0.0,"Despite some initial vulnerabilities at T1, such as low positive mental health and life satisfaction, the individual shows significant improvement in protective factors like self-efficacy and life satisfaction by T2, alongside reductions in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology. These positive changes suggest that a new psychological disorder is unlikely to have developed between T1 and T2."
0.0,"Despite some increases in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology between T1 and T2, the significant improvements in protective factors such as positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction suggest a positive trajectory, likely preventing the development of a new psychological disorder. Additionally, the baseline at T1 shows low levels of distress and risk factors, further supporting resilience against disorder onset."
