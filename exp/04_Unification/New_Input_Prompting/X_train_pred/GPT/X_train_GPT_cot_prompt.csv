0,"Despite low education and extremely low life satisfaction at T1 (which are risk factors), there is marked improvement in life satisfaction, social support, and stable or improved general self-efficacy between T1 and T2; the increase in dysfunctional attitudes and GSI is moderate, but given the very low initial psychopathology and overall improvement in most protective factors, there is insufficient evidence for new disorder development."
0,"Despite low education and initial high psychopathology at T1 (suggesting a possible ongoing disorder), key protective factors (positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction) improved substantially from T1 to T2, and general psychopathology strongly decreased, indicating recovery or sustained mental health rather than development of a new disorder."
0,"The individual had strong protective factors at T1 (high education, SES, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and low stress/distress), and although dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology increased somewhat over time, levels of risk factors remained low to average, and there were continued protective strengths, making the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2 unlikely."
0,"Although this individual began with several risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy; elevated stress and emotion-focused coping; above-average psychopathology), T2 shows no substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI decreased), and there is not a major rise in risk factors; thus, there is no clear pattern indicating the onset of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, high social support) and, despite a moderate increase in general psychopathology at T2, most key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes) remained low or decreased, while life satisfaction rose sharply—making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"The individual started with a relatively healthy baseline (low psychological distress, high social support, and only mildly elevated risk factors), retained stable or improved risk signals (e.g., decrease in general psychopathology, increased positive mental health), and though experienced decreases in life satisfaction and self-efficacy and a rise in fear of bodily sensations, there is no major elevation in overall risk or psychopathology to suggest the development of a new disorder at T2."
0,"The individual had some baseline risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health and elevated general psychopathology), but also several protective factors (average to slightly good social support, life satisfaction, coping, low dysfunctional attitudes). From T1 to T2, key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, GSI) actually decreased, while positive mental health and life satisfaction improved and there was no significant overall increase in psychological distress—suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite very high stress at T1 and a large increase in general psychopathology, this individual started with multiple protective factors (elevated positive mental health, self-efficacy, coping, and social support, and especially strong socioeconomic status). Furthermore, most risk factors (e.g., dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity) either decreased or remained low, and crucially, life satisfaction greatly improved by T2, all supporting the conclusion that a new psychological disorder likely did not develop."
0,"Despite lower education and socioeconomic status (risk factors), the person’s T1 mental health profile is overall healthy with high self-efficacy, strong coping, low general psychopathology, and notably low dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations. Changes from T1 to T2 reflect stable or improved protective factors and no major rise in core risk factors, making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"The person started with high life satisfaction, positive mental health, and low psychological distress at T1, despite low self-efficacy and social support. Between T1 and T2, protective factors such as positive mental health, self-efficacy, and social support all increased significantly while risk factors and general psychopathology (GSI) decreased, suggesting improved psychological resilience and no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some demographic risk factors (lower education and socioeconomic status, higher BMI), the individual showed strong baseline protective factors at T1 (very low psychopathology, low anxiety sensitivity/fear, low dysfunctional attitudes, low stress, reasonable self-efficacy, and social support), and only modest negative change in GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, and positive mental health from T1 to T2—none of which reached a substantial enough magnitude or pattern to indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite socioeconomic disadvantages and low initial self-efficacy and positive mental health at T1, the person did not develop a psychological disorder, as T1 measures indicate low psychopathological risk (very low anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI) and no major risk increases at T2; the pronounced rise in positive mental health and self-efficacy at T2 further suggests resilience, even with the substantial decrease in social support and rise in risk factors, as GSI remains low and not indicative of new disorder onset."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and high stress/GSI at T1 indicating risk, the individual showed substantial reductions in general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, and fear of bodily sensations from T1 to T2, as well as increases in social support and self-efficacy, suggesting recovery rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual displayed high protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, problem-focused coping) and high risk factors (very elevated anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations) at T1, but their psychological distress (GSI) was only slightly above average and decreased over time, with no major negative shifts in key protective variables. Despite some reduction in positive factors, there is no evidence of a significant worsening or onset of psychopathology between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual began with strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, low stress and psychopathology) and although there is a notable drop in life satisfaction and a moderate increase in general psychopathology, most risk factors remain low or even decrease further. There is no compelling evidence for new psychological disorder development, as the risk profile remains low and protective factors, though somewhat diminished, are still present."
0,"Despite increases in several risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI) between T1 and T2, the individual started with very strong protective factors at T1—low general psychopathology, low stress, high social support, low dysfunctional attitudes, and a substantial reduction in problem areas. Improvements in positive mental health, general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction further indicate resilience, making new disorder onset unlikely."
1,"The individual initially showed average positive mental health, high self-efficacy, and low psychopathology, but experienced large decreases in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction from T1 to T2 alongside increased anxiety sensitivity and a slight rise in general psychopathology; this substantial decline in key protective factors and rise in multiple risk factors strongly suggest the development of a psychological disorder at T2."
0,"This person already exhibited significant psychological difficulties at T1, including high general psychopathology, low life satisfaction, high stress, and elevated risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes; their symptoms actually decreased from T1 to T2. There is no evidence of developing a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2, but rather some improvement in functioning."
1,"The person started with generally good mental health but low self-efficacy and very low social support, and then showed very large increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and global psychopathology from T1 to T2—risk factors that, coupled with increased dysfunctional attitudes and marked psychological distress, strongly indicate new disorder development."
1,"The individual began with relatively healthy baseline indicators and low psychological distress at T1, but experienced notable increases in multiple risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, general psychopathology) and a moderate decline in protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction) between T1 and T2, indicating new onset of psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with several protective factors at T1, including high social support, high life satisfaction, very low stress, and low general psychopathology, and then showed substantial improvement in positive mental health and decreases in several key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes) by T2. Although general psychopathology increased, the strength and direction of protective changes and the absence of significant increases in core risk factors strongly suggest no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person starts with low risk (low stress, low anxiety sensitivity/fear, low dysfunctional attitudes, low psychopathology at T1) and demonstrates improvements in most protective factors (increased positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) with minimal increases in risk factors. There is no evidence of worsening, and general psychopathology slightly decreases, making new disorder development highly unlikely."
0,"Although risk factors such as low positive mental health, low social support, high dysfunctional attitudes, and high general psychopathology were present at T1, these represent an ongoing disorder rather than new onset. From T1 to T2, key protective factors (positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction) improved and general psychopathology decreased, indicating recovery or stability rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual was psychologically healthy at T1, with high education, strong social support, high life satisfaction, low stress, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, and strong coping resources. Despite notable drops in life satisfaction and small increases in psychopathology by T2, protective factors such as increased self-efficacy and decreases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) suggest resilience and adaptation, making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"The individual showed some baseline vulnerability (low positive mental health, life satisfaction, and moderately high dysfunctional attitudes at T1) but no substantial increase in general psychopathology or distress by T2. Despite increased anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, there were concurrent protective trends (e.g., improvements in positive mental health, stable or slightly improved life satisfaction, a strong decrease in dysfunctional attitudes, and decreased general psychopathology), indicating no meaningful new disorder developed."
0,"Although the person started with some sociodemographic risk factors (lower education, higher BMI, lower socioeconomic status) and low positive mental health and life satisfaction at T1, their T1 psychological profile was strongly protected: high self-efficacy, very low anxiety sensitivity and fear, very low dysfunctional attitudes, and low general psychopathology. Between T1 and T2, protective factors improved further (notably, self-efficacy and life satisfaction greatly increased), and the mild increase in risk factors and GSI were small in magnitude, indicating no development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low self-efficacy, poor social support, and some increase in risk factors (such as dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology), the individual already had mildly elevated risk at T1 and did not start from a psychologically healthy baseline; there is no evidence they developed a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual had a very healthy psychological profile at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, strong social support, very low stress, and low psychopathology) and, although there were moderate declines in self-efficacy and life satisfaction with mild increases in risk factors, the overall profile does not reach a level strongly suggestive of new disorder development; the baseline resilience and only moderate worsening indicate lowered well-being rather than a clear emergence of psychopathology."
1,"Although the person started with strong protective factors and relatively low psychopathology at T1, there was a dramatic increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and fear of bodily sensations at T2, accompanied by sharp decreases in self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support, indicating the likely development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started with several risk factors at T1 (high stress, high fear of bodily sensations, moderate dysfunctional attitudes, and clinically significant general psychopathology), but these indicators all improved or remained stable by T2, as shown by decreased general psychopathology and reduced anxiety sensitivity, fear, and dysfunctional attitudes. Despite low education and ongoing low life satisfaction, the overall change reflects reduced risk, not the onset of a new disorder."
0,"Despite initial high risk factors at T1 (very low self-efficacy and social support, high stress, dysfunctional attitudes, and psychopathology), there are substantial protective changes between T1 and T2: large decreases in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, as well as a strong increase in self-efficacy and social support. This pattern strongly suggests recovery or sustained disorder, not new onset, so no new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite large increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations (risk factors), the individual’s positive mental health and general self-efficacy substantially improved, while general psychopathology (GSI) actually decreased—suggesting strengthened psychological resilience and no evidence for the emergence of a new disorder."
0,"The individual started with generally good mental health (above-average positive mental health, social support, and moderate coping), and experienced further improvements in several key protective factors (increased positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; decreased anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology). Despite a notable increase in dysfunctional attitudes, the overall trend of enhanced protective factors and reduced risk factors suggests they did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and high stress at T1, the individual showed strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, social support, problem-focused coping, and low dysfunctional attitudes) and further improved or stable social support and life satisfaction by T2. Importantly, general psychopathology markedly decreased, making the onset of a new disorder unlikely."
0,"The individual already exhibits slightly negative mental health at T1 but no significant elevation in psychopathology or risk factors, and shows improvements or stability in most areas (increased social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, no increase in psychopathology) from T1 to T2; therefore, there is no evidence of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the person started with some elevated risk factors at T1 (high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), their overall psychological risk profile improved between T1 and T2—most notably with strong decreases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, general psychopathology, and no substantial worsening of other variables—indicating that they did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low baseline life satisfaction and moderately elevated risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) at T1, this individual exhibited strong protective factors such as high self-efficacy, social support, positive mental health, and adaptive coping, with only minimal overall increases in psychopathology and a reduction in key risk factors by T2—suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, low anxiety sensitivity), and while there was a notable drop in self-efficacy at T2, most risk factors remained low or decreased further (especially dysfunctional attitudes, fear, and psychopathology stayed low). There is no evidence of a development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low education and socioeconomic status (risk factors) and a moderate increase in psychopathology from T1 to T2, the person had a healthy psychological baseline (very low GSI and risk factors at T1), experienced improvements in positive mental health and self-efficacy, and only a moderate rise in GSI—suggesting no clear development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual began with elevated anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations alongside low positive mental health and social support at T1 (risk factors), the substantial reductions in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology from T1 to T2 indicate improvement rather than worsening; increased self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction further support psychological resilience and strongly suggest that no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite low education and high initial stress and dysfunctional attitudes at T1, the individual had good positive mental health, high life satisfaction, and average social support. Between T1 and T2, protective factors like social support and self-efficacy improved, while risk factors including dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology decreased—indicating they did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual began with strong protective factors (high positive mental health, life satisfaction, low stress, low psychopathology) and although positive mental health decreased, general self-efficacy improved greatly, and there were no substantial increases in risk factors or psychopathology; thus, there is no clear pattern suggesting development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had some risk factors at T1 (notably elevated anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, as well as moderate dysfunctional attitudes), but also strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction). From T1 to T2, most risk factors decreased—including substantial reductions in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology—while positive mental health improved, indicating decreasing risk and no evidence suggestive of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the person started with high psychopathology and several risk factors at T1, their general psychopathology (GSI) dropped dramatically by T2 along with notable decreases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, while life satisfaction and positive mental health both improved—indicating recovery or substantial symptom remission rather than the emergence of a new disorder."
0,"The individual already exhibited extremely high levels of psychological distress and risk factors at T1 (e.g., GSI, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes), indicating an existing psychological disorder at baseline; despite some worsening in overall distress at T2, this does not represent the onset of a new disorder but rather the persistence or escalation of pre-existing psychopathology."
1,"Although the person had a high general self-efficacy and low psychopathology at T1, they initially showed low positive mental health and moderately elevated dysfunctional attitudes. Between T1 and T2, marked increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI), combined with pronounced declines in self-efficacy and only minor increases in protective factors, suggest the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite demographic risk factors (lower education, higher BMI, lower socioeconomic status), the individual started at T1 with strong protective factors (very high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low general psychopathology). Although there are increases in risk factors at T2 (notably higher dysfunctional attitudes and fear of bodily sensations, large drop in life satisfaction, and increased psychopathology), the magnitude and direction of these changes, alongside continued protective factors such as initially robust social support and low baseline psychopathology, do not strongly indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started at T1 with strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, adaptive coping, low psychopathology and risk attitudes), and although there were decreases in wellbeing and self-efficacy along with some worsening in life satisfaction at T2, there were further decreases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, GSI, dysfunctional attitudes). Overall, protective factors remain high and risk factors low or further improved, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Although the individual experienced a sharp decline in positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction between T1 and T2 (with an increase in dysfunctional attitudes), their initial protective factors were exceptionally strong—including high positive mental health, social support, low psychopathology, and very low dysfunctional attitudes at T1. The changes, though negative, do not show a clinically significant increase in psychopathology or risk factors to a degree that suggests disorder onset."
0,"The person already showed strong risk factors and high general psychopathology at T1, indicating they likely already had a psychological disorder at baseline; while mental health worsened further by T2, there is no evidence that the individual was healthy at T1, so this does not represent the onset of a new disorder between time points."
0,"The individual had some slightly elevated risk at T1 (lower positive mental health, higher anxiety sensitivity), but these risk factors substantially decreased by T2, with improvements in key variables (lower anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI), and no significant demographic risk, indicating no development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a significant decrease in positive mental health, most risk factors (such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) and the overall GSI either decreased or remained stable, while social support and self-efficacy increased—together suggesting the person did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite having low social support, low self-efficacy, high stress, and moderate psychological distress at T1, the individual shows strong improvements between T1 and T2, with substantial increases in social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, and a large reduction in general psychopathology. There is no evidence of new disorder development; rather, the risk profile greatly improves from T1 to T2."
0,"The individual began with overall strong protective factors—high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with low stress and very low general psychopathology at T1. Despite a slight increase in general psychopathology by T2, there were notable improvements in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, along with strong reductions in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations; this pattern does not suggest the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this person has very low baseline socioeconomic status, education, and BMI (all risk factors), and very low social support and coping at T1, their T1 mental health profile is relatively low in distress and dysfunctional attitudes (protective), and from T1 to T2, their general psychopathology (GSI) actually decreases. Despite a dramatic spike in dysfunctional attitudes, there are simultaneous substantial increases in life satisfaction and social support, and reductions in anxiety sensitivity and GSI, indicating that the individual is not developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with significant risk factors at T1 (low social support, low self-efficacy, high anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes) but showed strong improvements by T2 across almost all protective factors, including large increases in social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and positive mental health, while general psychopathology remained well below average; this profile indicates recovery or resilience rather than the development of a new disorder."
0,"The person began T1 with very strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress and psychopathology, very low dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear), and although there was a moderate worsening in life satisfaction, protective factors remained overall strong with only minor risk factor increases; there is no strong evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some decreases in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy) and an increase in anxiety sensitivity, the individual had very low risk factors and high protective factors at T1 (low psychopathology, high life satisfaction, low dysfunctional attitudes), and the changes between T1 and T2 are modest; there is no strong indication of new disorder development."
0,"The person showed some elevated risk factors at T1 (high stress, low life satisfaction, high fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), but their general psychopathology (GSI) was essentially average at T1 and increased only minimally at T2. Moreover, several risk factors (fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) sharply decreased by T2, and key protective factors (positive mental health) improved, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Despite a relatively healthy psychological baseline at T1 (high life satisfaction, strong social support, low stress, low anxiety sensitivity and fear, and very low dysfunctional attitudes), this individual experienced substantial decreases in protective factors (general self-efficacy and life satisfaction), sharp increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), and declining social support by T2—collectively indicating the likely development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with low risk (healthy at T1: low distress, high protective factors like self-efficacy and life satisfaction, low risk factors such as dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity). Over time, key protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support) all improved, and there were no significant increases in risk factors or overall psychopathology, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"The individual had solid protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, coping, social support, and low psychopathology), and from T1 to T2, most risk factors decreased (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, GSI), with only minor reductions in some protective factors (life satisfaction, social support). Overall, there is no evidence for the onset of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite high initial stress, the individual began with strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low GSI), and these generally improved further over time—particularly a marked increase in positive mental health and reduced fear of bodily sensations—without a substantial rise in overall psychological distress, indicating no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The person exhibited significant psychological distress and low protective factors at T1, consistent with a pre-existing or ongoing psychological disorder, but showed improvement or stability in most risk factors by T2 (notably reduced general psychopathology and marked increase in social support), indicating no new psychological disorder developed during the observed period."
0,"Although there were extreme risk factors evident at T1 (very high stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and significant psychopathology), these all substantially decreased by T2 (notably large drops in fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI), suggesting significant recovery or improvement rather than the development of a new disorder."
0,"The individual starts with very strong protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and low psychopathology), and although there is a substantial decline in positive mental health by T2, other risk factors remain low or improve (e.g., anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes decrease further), and general psychopathology remains low. There is no strong evidence for the emergence of new psychological disorder despite the drop in positive mental health."
0,"Despite very high baseline risk factors (very low social support and life satisfaction, low SES, and moderately elevated dysfunctional attitudes), this individual experiences substantial protective changes from T1 to T2: large increases in social support, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy, as well as a dramatic decrease in dysfunctional attitudes. General psychopathology remains low, and although positive mental health decreases, the net increase in protective factors and reduction of key risk factors suggest no new disorder developed."
0,"The individual began with low positive mental health and life satisfaction at T1, but these and other protective factors improved substantially by T2, with increases in social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction. Although general psychopathology and fear of bodily sensations increased slightly, these changes were moderate, and there are no strong signs of new disorder development given the overall improvement in protective factors."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and low T1 positive mental health, the person demonstrates increased protective factors between T1 and T2 such as improved positive mental health and self-efficacy, and a substantial decrease in general psychopathology; while dysfunctional attitudes increased, overall risk of developing a new disorder is low given the improvements and lack of clinical-level distress."
0,"Although socioeconomic status is low (a risk factor), most T1 protective factors (life satisfaction, social support, and lower stress) are high or average, and risk factors like dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology are low. While general psychopathology increases by T2, many protective factors (self-efficacy, positive mental health, social support) also improve, and there is no strong evidence for the emergence of a new disorder."
0,"Although initial T1 psychopathology was elevated, most risk factors decreased or remained stable over time (notably, a large decrease in general psychopathology), while protective factors such as social support and life satisfaction improved. There is no pattern of worsening or significant new risk, indicating the individual did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"Despite some improvements in social support, life satisfaction, and positive mental health, this person started at T1 with multiple risk factors (very low social support, low self-efficacy, negative mental health) and experienced a very large increase in the GSI (general psychopathology) at T2, strongly suggesting the onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although there were significant risk factors at baseline (notably high stress, low life satisfaction, low social support, and very high dysfunctional attitudes), the key risk markers either remained stable or improved over time (notably, a substantial decrease in general psychopathology and only a mild increase in dysfunctional attitudes). There is no indication of a new disorder developing, as distress and psychopathology decreased rather than increased."
0,"The person began with moderate risk due to low positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction, but also had strong protective factors (low anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and low psychopathology). While general psychopathology increased slightly, there were gains in protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support) and no significant new risk factors emerged; this pattern does not indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support; low psychopathology) and saw further increases in social support and positive mental health at T2, despite a rise in dysfunctional attitudes and slight increases in general psychopathology and anxiety sensitivity—these risk factors do not outweigh the robust, sustained protective factors, making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"Although there are very high risk factors and general psychopathology at T1, indicating existing psychological disorder at baseline, most risk variables and general psychopathology decrease substantially from T1 to T2; thus, there is no evidence of a new disorder developing between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there was a decline in protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support) and an increase in general psychopathology, this individual already showed substantial psychological impairment at T1 (high GSI), so their pattern is consistent with ongoing rather than new disorder development."
0,"Although this individual exhibited very high psychological distress and several risk factors at T1, all indicators at T2 improve markedly—most notably, a substantial reduction in psychopathology (GSI), increased self-efficacy, and much higher life satisfaction—indicating either recovery or a significant decrease in risk, not the development of a new disorder."
1,"Although many protective factors at T1 were strong (high self-efficacy, high life satisfaction, low stress, good coping), a very large increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and an extreme drop in life satisfaction between T1 and T2 suggest the emergence of new significant psychological distress, consistent with the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The person starts with high protective factors (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support; low stress and dysfunctional attitudes), and although there is a modest decrease in positive mental health and life satisfaction and an increase in dysfunctional attitudes, key risk factors (GSI, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations) all decrease or remain low from T1 to T2. There is no evidence of significant deterioration or development of psychological distress indicative of a new disorder."
0,"While there are low protective demographic factors (low education and BMI), the baseline at T1 is quite mentally healthy—very high life satisfaction, low stress, low distress, and low anxiety sensitivity/fear—with only below-average positive mental health and social support as minor risks. Despite decreases in self-efficacy and life satisfaction and increases in some risk factors (notably anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), general psychopathology only increased slightly and remains below average, indicating no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Although there is a notable increase in general psychopathology and anxiety sensitivity, the individual began with strong protective factors (high positive mental health and life satisfaction, low stress, negative dysfunctional attitudes, and below-average general psychopathology) and further improvements in social support and life satisfaction from T1 to T2, suggesting they did not cross the threshold into a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had generally low risk at baseline, with adequate social support, high life satisfaction, low overall psychopathology, and only mildly elevated fear of bodily sensations. Between T1 and T2, key risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology actually decreased, despite a rise in dysfunctional attitudes, resulting overall in no clear pattern of new disorder development."
0,"The individual started with some psychological risk factors at T1—low positive mental health, raised stress, and high dysfunctional attitudes—but also had strong protective factors, such as high social support and self-efficacy, and low psychopathology. By T2, their key protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction, self-efficacy) markedly improved, risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity) decreased, and although general psychopathology increased slightly, it remained within a non-clinical range; thus, there is no clear evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this person had elevated risk factors (e.g., high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and psychopathology) at T1, their positive mental health improved dramatically and their psychopathology score showed a large decrease by T2, indicating substantial psychological recovery rather than the emergence of a new disorder."
0,"Despite a low baseline in several protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) at T1, this person exhibits strong positive changes in positive mental health and social support, as well as reductions in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations by T2. While there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, the substantial increases in protective factors make it unlikely that this person developed a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"Although the person had low stress and high life satisfaction at T1, they already presented elevated anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations (risk factors). Between T1 and T2, there are strong increases in general psychopathology, decreased self-efficacy and life satisfaction, major loss of social support, and increased anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, all indicating substantial psychological deterioration and new disorder onset."
0,"The individual already exhibited very high general psychopathology, stress, and anxiety sensitivity at T1, indicating an existing psychological disorder rather than developing a new one between T1 and T2; despite reductions in protective factors and social support, there is no evidence of transition from healthy to disordered, and overall psychopathology actually decreased by T2."
1,"The individual was psychologically healthy at T1 but experienced substantial increases in risk factors by T2, notably a strong rise in dysfunctional attitudes and increased anxiety sensitivity, with declines in social support and positive mental health; this pattern is characteristic of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual showed very severe psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes already at T1, indicating an existing psychological disorder rather than the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2; while some risk factors worsened (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and self-efficacy declined), the Global Severity Index actually decreased, and T1 levels already clearly exceeded the threshold for psychopathology, so this pattern does not reflect new-onset disorder."
0,"Despite notable risk factors in the demographics (lower education and socioeconomic status) and some vulnerability at T1 (low positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction), the person experienced substantial increases in protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction, and social support) between T1 and T2. While there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology and anxiety sensitivity, the strong improvements in positive mental health and life satisfaction outweigh these risks, making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"Although this person experiences notable increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology at T2) and a sharp drop in self-efficacy and life satisfaction, their baseline protective factors at T1 (very high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and low psychopathology) were robust, suggesting a high resilience against developing a new disorder over 17 months despite demographic vulnerabilities."
1,"While the individual started with relatively low risk—healthy psychological baseline at T1 (low stress, low psychopathology, some social support)—there was a pronounced increase in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes from T1 to T2, along with a notable drop in social support and a decrease in positive mental health, altogether indicating a considerable deterioration and likely development of a psychological disorder at T2."
0,"Despite initially elevated risk factors at T1 (high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and low self-efficacy and life satisfaction), this individual experienced substantial improvements by T2 in social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and a marked reduction in general psychopathology; thus, there is no evidence of new disorder onset."
0,"Although there is an increase in dysfunctional attitudes and a decrease in social support and self-efficacy, the individual starts with relatively low risk (low psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes at T1) and most risk indicators remain within mild ranges, with protective factors like life satisfaction and positive mental health actually improving from T1 to T2. The overall magnitude and pattern do not suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there is a notable decrease in positive mental health and social support coupled with increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, the individual still exhibits strong protective factors at baseline (high socioeconomic status, self-efficacy, social support, low initial psychopathology and stress), and general psychopathology slightly decreases at T2, suggesting resilience and no clear development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Although this individual started with extremely high positive mental health, their initial profile showed some vulnerabilities (low social support, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, elevated GSI). From T1 to T2, there was a strong increase in general psychopathology and anxiety sensitivity, combined with a notable drop in positive mental health, indicating the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although risk factors were present at T1 (low positive mental health, low social support, elevated stress, subpar life satisfaction, some dysfunctional attitudes, and mild psychopathology), there were substantial improvements between T1 and T2 in positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction, which are strong protective factors. While there was a moderate increase in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, the marked gains in wellbeing and support suggest the person did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although the person initially exhibited some risk factors at T1 (high general psychopathology, high anxiety sensitivity, high fear of bodily sensations, low self-efficacy, and poor social support), these problems improved between T1 and T2 (notably, general psychopathology declined substantially and self-efficacy increased), suggesting a recovery rather than the new onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual exhibited significant psychological distress and multiple risk factors already at T1 (very high GSI, high stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations), but showed considerable improvements in nearly all risk factors and a strong decrease in general psychopathology by T2; thus, there is no evidence of a newly developed psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual already exhibited high levels of psychological distress and multiple risk factors (elevated GSI, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, stress, and dysfunctional attitudes) at T1, suggesting a likely ongoing psychological disorder rather than new onset at T2; while there are some improvements in risk factors and increases in protective factors, the pattern does not indicate the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and education (risk factors), the person was psychologically healthy at T1, with high positive mental health, self-efficacy, and problem-focused coping. Although there is a drop in self-efficacy and life satisfaction and a rise in psychopathology from T1 to T2, the improvement in social support, reduction in dysfunctional attitudes, and low/modest increases in risk variables suggest no clear emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual started with low socioeconomic status and education (risk factors), their baseline mental health at T1 was quite positive (high positive mental health, low dysfunctional attitudes, minimal distress) and, despite notable decreases in protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction), their general psychopathology and anxiety-related risk factors actually decreased from T1 to T2, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite a large drop in positive mental health and some ongoing elevations in risk factors at T1 (elevated fear of bodily sensations, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes), there is no significant worsening in general psychopathology or dysfunctional attitudes, and some protective factors (social support, self-efficacy) actually increase over time. Overall, the balance of risk and protective factors along with stable GSI suggests this person did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual started with strong protective factors (high positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction), but between T1 and T2 showed extremely large increases in several risk factors—most notably anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, alongside increased dysfunctional attitudes and worsening global psychopathology—suggesting the development of a psychological disorder at T2."
0,"Despite a moderately poor psychological baseline at T1 (low positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, high dysfunctional attitudes and GSI), the individual shows strong positive changes in protective factors (marked increases in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and a significant decrease in general psychopathology between T1 and T2, indicating psychological improvement rather than new disorder development."
0,"Although some risk factors are present (low socioeconomic status, low social support, high baseline psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and low life satisfaction at T1), the individual already met criteria for psychological disorder at T1, so the pattern does not indicate the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual showed low risk at T1 (low psychopathology, low stress, and low dysfunctional attitudes), and despite some residual low protective factors (e.g., self-efficacy), nearly all key risk factors decreased or remained low between T1 and T2, with improvements in coping resources and well-being—suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The person exhibited significant psychological distress and risk factors at T1 (high GSI, stress, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, extremely low life satisfaction, and self-efficacy), indicating an existing psychological disorder at baseline; although some variables improved between T1 and T2, there is no evidence that the person was healthy at T1 and developed a new disorder at T2."
1,"The individual began at T1 with multiple risk factors including low positive mental health, low social support, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, and very high dysfunctional attitudes. Over time, further decreases in protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support) and increases in risk factors (fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, GSI) strongly suggest the onset of a new psychological disorder at T2."
1,"The individual began with several risk factors at T1 (low social support, low self-efficacy, high stress, and high dysfunctional attitudes), and despite some increase in protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction), there was a very large increase in key risk factors between T1 and T2—most notably anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations—along with a moderate rise in general psychopathology, strongly indicating the development of a psychological disorder by T2."
0,"Despite an increase in several risk factors between T1 and T2 (notably large rises in dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and general psychopathology), the individual already exhibited significant psychological difficulties at T1 (very low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, high stress, extremely low social support, and elevated dysfunctional attitudes) and was not psychologically healthy to begin with. Therefore, this pattern does not reflect the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2 but rather the continuation—and worsening—of pre-existing problems."
0,"Although this person starts with low socioeconomic status and BMI (risk factors), their T1 mental health is surprisingly resilient: low psychopathology, high social support, and strong protective factors despite elevated stress. Between T1 and T2, risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes, GSI) increase, but starting levels were very low, and positive mental health and life satisfaction improve, suggesting some recovery or resilience; overall, these patterns do not strongly indicate the clear development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person started at T1 with low positive mental health but strong protective factors (high social support, above-average self-efficacy, problem-focused coping, and life satisfaction, with low psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes). By T2, protective factors generally strengthened (large increases in positive mental health and self-efficacy; most risk factors decreased or remained low), and although there was a moderate increase in general psychopathology, it likely reflects normal fluctuation rather than onset of a disorder given the overall positive trend and lack of significant risk elevation."
0,"Despite low baseline positive mental health and coping at T1, this person experienced notable improvements in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, suggesting increases in protective factors; although general psychopathology increased somewhat, it likely remains within a nonclinical range given the starting value, indicating no clear development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there is a notable increase in general psychopathology and a large drop in social support and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, the person was already experiencing significant stress and above-average psychological distress at T1, suggesting an ongoing or persisting issue rather than the development of a new disorder. Thus, this pattern is more consistent with the continuation or aggravation of pre-existing problems, not the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there is a notable drop in positive mental health and a moderate increase in general psychopathology, other risk factors (such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes) actually decrease between T1 and T2, and several protective factors (social support, life satisfaction) remain positive or improve. Overall, there is no compelling pattern of new disorder development — the person appears to remain largely resilient and benefited from protective factors despite some increase in distress."
0,"The individual showed several baseline risk factors at T1 (high stress, low self-efficacy, elevated psychopathology), but from T1 to T2, protective factors increased (notably social support and self-efficacy), and key risk factors sharply decreased (GSI and dysfunctional attitudes). These positive changes indicate recovery or no onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual began with several strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress, negative dysfunctional attitudes, low psychopathology), and most risk factors remained low or improved over time (notably, positive mental health and self-efficacy increased, while general psychopathology remained below average despite a moderate uptick). There is no clear pattern of new disorder development."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and high initial stress, the individual had low baseline psychopathology, strong social support, positive self-efficacy, and low risk on negative thinking at T1. While there are moderate increases in certain risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, GSI), protective factors and improvements in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction outweigh the risks, suggesting no new disorder developed."
1,"Although baseline risk was low at T1 due to protective factors like high social support, low stress, low psychopathology, and low anxiety/fear, there is a marked increase in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes from T1 to T2, combined with large declines in social support and life satisfaction, suggesting the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with some risk (low positive mental health, self-efficacy, and low socioeconomic status, plus high stress), but from T1 to T2 showed substantial improvements in positive mental health and self-efficacy and a notable decrease in general psychopathology; there is no evidence of new disorder emergence."
0,"Although there is a dramatic drop in positive mental health and increases in some risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), the general psychopathology index (GSI) remains stable and below average, suggesting no clear emergence of a new psychological disorder despite a substantial decline in well-being and protective factors."
1,"The individual started with extremely high positive mental health but already had low social support, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, high dysfunctional attitudes, and average psychopathology. By T2, there were dramatic declines in positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support, and a large increase in overall psychological distress (GSI), clearly indicating the development of a psychological disorder."
1,"The individual starts with strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, low psychopathology, and low dysfunctional attitudes), but between T1 and T2 exhibits sizable increases in multiple risk factors—including anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology—along with large decreases in protective factors like social support and self-efficacy. This pattern strongly suggests the development of a new psychological disorder at T2."
0,"The individual already showed significant psychological distress and poor mental health at T1, but most indicators either improved or did not worsen by T2 (notably: decreases in general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and stable or negative changes across most risk factors). There is no evidence of new-onset disorder, but rather a possible ongoing condition or partial recovery."
0,"Although the individual experienced declines in social support and self-efficacy and a moderate increase in general psychopathology, their baseline mental health was strong (low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, high self-efficacy), and the overall increase in risk factors was moderate, not suggesting the clear emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual started with multiple risk factors at T1 (low socioeconomic status, extremely low social support and self-efficacy, high dysfunctional attitudes, and above-average psychopathology), key indicators of a new disorder are not met because they were already struggling at T1; despite some risk factors worsening (notably GSI and fear of bodily sensations), there is significant improvement in dysfunctional attitudes, social support, and positive mental health. Thus, these changes do not indicate the new onset of a psychological disorder, but likely represent ongoing or chronic difficulties."
1,"Despite strong protective factors at T1 (very high positive mental health, life satisfaction, and problem-focused coping), the individual showed a significant increase in anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology from T1 to T2, along with a notable drop in life satisfaction; combined with low socioeconomic status and education, these changes indicate a substantial risk for developing a psychological disorder by T2."
0,"The person shows generally strong protective factors at T1—high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support, with low psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes. Although there are increases in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology from T1 to T2, these values remain moderate, and most risk factors (e.g., positive mental health, coping) stay within a non-clinical range, suggesting a new psychological disorder is unlikely to have developed."
1,"The individual was psychologically healthy at T1, but showed a dramatic increase in general psychopathology (GSI) at T2, alongside sharp declines in self-efficacy and life satisfaction—strong indicators that a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite low baseline life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and social support, as well as elevated anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes at T1, there is evidence of improvement in protective factors (increases in positive mental health and life satisfaction, decrease in dysfunctional attitudes) and minimal change in overall psychopathology. Socioeconomic status is strongly protective, and overall, there is not a clear pattern of developing a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person starts with strong protective factors (high life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy, and very low stress) and, despite some decreases in life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and social support at T2, there remains a notable increase in positive mental health and continued low levels of risk factors (low anxiety sensitivity, low GSI, low dysfunctional attitudes at T1). The slight rise in GSI and dysfunctional attitudes is modest, and there is no substantial jump in psychopathology or key risk factors indicative of new disorder onset."
0,"Despite significant decreases in protective factors such as positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction, and a notable increase in fear of bodily sensations, the individual began with very high self-efficacy, strong social support, high life satisfaction, low stress, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low general psychopathology at T1. The level of risk increase does not appear to reach the threshold typically required for the development of a psychological disorder, especially given the initially strong protective factors and only a mild increase in psychopathology."
0,"Although there are some increases in certain risk factors (such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), the person started with low baseline risk (very low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, low anxiety sensitivity, good stress levels) and other domains actually improved (e.g., life satisfaction and self-efficacy increased, GSI decreased, and negative changes in social support and positive mental health were modest). Overall, no pattern suggests development of a new disorder; rather, the individual remains psychologically stable or even improved in some domains."
0,"Despite some increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), marked improvements in key protective factors (a large positive shift in positive mental health, increased social support, and increased self-efficacy) suggest the individual is unlikely to have developed a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite strong declines in positive mental health and increases in general psychopathology and fear of bodily sensations, the individual maintains high and improving protective factors (self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support), and baseline risk factors and general distress were low, making the emergence of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2 unlikely."
0,"The person started with moderate risk factors (low positive mental health, low coping), but strong protective factors (low stress, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, moderate life satisfaction, average SES/education), and although there were increases in certain risk factors at T2 (notably anxiety sensitivity and GSI), protective factors such as positive mental health and social support improved. The changes do not clearly indicate the emergence of a new psychological disorder, especially with GSI still likely in the non-clinical range."
0,"The individual already exhibited elevated risk factors at T1 (very low social support, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, high dysfunctional attitudes, and above-average psychopathology), indicating probable ongoing psychological difficulties or disorder. Despite some worsening in supportive variables at T2 (e.g., life satisfaction), overall general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations actually decreased, suggesting no development of a new disorder but rather continuing or slightly improving ongoing issues."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors, such as high positive mental health, life satisfaction, and low stress and psychopathology; while there was a moderate rise in anxiety sensitivity, self-efficacy substantially improved and most psychological risk factors remained stable or low, suggesting no clear development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there was a dramatic decline in positive mental health, the person’s already high general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, and low social support at T1 suggest a pre-existing risk rather than the onset of a new disorder; additionally, significant improvements from T1 to T2 in general psychopathology and a decrease in dysfunctional attitudes indicate recovery or ongoing status rather than new disorder development."
0,"The individual showed improvements in protective factors including a strong increase in positive mental health and life satisfaction, as well as a substantial decrease in dysfunctional attitudes and fear of bodily sensations, despite some elevation in psychological distress; this pattern does not suggest the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low education and socioeconomic status as demographic risk factors, the person was psychologically healthy at T1 (very high self-efficacy, low psychopathology, good coping skills, and low risk attitudes). Although they experienced declines in life satisfaction and increased general psychopathology at T2, their overall risk remains low due to the strong T1 protective factors and no evidence they shifted from 'healthy' to 'disordered'—the pattern is more suggestive of decreased well-being, not clear development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual showed substantial increases in general psychopathology (GSI), fear of bodily sensations, and only modest improvement in protective factors, with significant losses in social support and life satisfaction; this pattern, especially given their already risk-laden baseline (low self-efficacy, high stress, low socioeconomic status), strongly suggests the onset of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"This person started T1 with strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; low distress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), and although there are some increases in risk factors (notably in GSI and loss of self-efficacy and social support), their baseline was very healthy and most increases remain within normal ranges; there is no evidence strong enough to suggest development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some demographic risk (low socioeconomic status, high BMI), at T1 the individual showed high stress, low social support, below-average life satisfaction, and mildly elevated dysfunctional attitudes, but no sign of existing psychopathology (low GSI). Over time, positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction all improved, and while risk factors including GSI, anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes increased, the profile does not indicate the emergence of a new psychological disorder, but rather a continued subclinical risk with some functional gains."
0,"The individual already showed extremely high general psychopathology, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, high stress, low social support, and high dysfunctional attitudes at T1—consistent with having a psychological disorder at baseline—which then substantially improved by T2, as indicated by large decreases in GSI and risk factors, making the emergence of a new disorder at T2 highly unlikely."
1,"Despite protective factors at T1 including high social support and self-efficacy, several key risk factors increased markedly from T1 to T2: there were large rises in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, combined with significant drops in social support and life satisfaction, which together strongly suggest the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual's T1 profile already shows significant risk: extremely low life satisfaction and self-efficacy, very high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and above-average psychopathology (GSI). The socioeconomic status and education are also well below average. However, none of these factors represent a change from healthy to disordered between T1 and T2—the person already appears disordered (or at serious risk) at T1, with only minor increases in psychopathology and some decreases in risk factors at T2. Therefore, there is no evidence of new disorder onset between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite the presence of demographic risk factors (lower education and socioeconomic status), the person displayed substantial protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health, high life satisfaction, low stress, and low dysfunctional attitudes). Over time, protective factors such as positive mental health and self-efficacy increased, while risk factors like fear of bodily sensations and general psychopathology decreased. The marked drop in life satisfaction is notable but is not accompanied by a rise in psychopathology or dysfunctional attitudes; thus, there is no evidence for new disorder development."
0,"The individual already exhibited very high general psychopathology (GSI), anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and extremely low social support and life satisfaction at T1, indicating a likely pre-existing psychological disorder; despite some further declines in positive mental health and social support by T2, general psychopathology and core risk factors substantially decreased, suggesting improvement or maintenance of an existing condition rather than onset of a new disorder."
0,"The person displayed significant psychological distress and elevated dysfunctional attitudes at T1, indicating an existing psychological disorder. Despite some increases in anxiety sensitivity, there are notable improvements in general psychopathology (GSI drops sharply) and modest gains in positive mental health, suggesting ongoing recovery rather than the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"Although the individual began at T1 with already low social support, low positive mental health, low life satisfaction, and elevated dysfunctional attitudes/anxiety sensitivity, the marked increase by T2 in dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations, anxiety sensitivity, general psychopathology, as well as a significant loss of social support, strongly suggest new onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual starts with good social support, average to slightly positive mental health indicators, and low risk factors (stress, anxiety sensitivity, GSI). Although there is a strong decrease in positive mental health at T2 and a moderate increase in anxiety sensitivity and GSI, increases in protective factors such as self-efficacy and stable social support suggest no clear evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low life satisfaction and positive mental health at T1, there are strong protective factors—high socioeconomic status, good social support, low general psychopathology, and no marked risk factors. At T2, large improvements in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction outweigh the minor increases in general psychopathology, indicating continued mental health stability without new disorder development."
0,"The individual exhibited severe psychological distress at T1 (very high GSI, low life satisfaction, low self-efficacy, high dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety/fear), so was already disordered at baseline. While some risk factors remain and protective factors further decreased by T2, there is no evidence of a new disorder emerging between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there were large reductions in positive mental health and life satisfaction, these were accompanied by major increases in protective factors (general self-efficacy, social support) and substantial decreases in key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and notably global psychopathology), suggesting improved overall mental health and no new disorder developed."
1,"Although this individual started with some protective factors at T1 (good social support, self-efficacy, and low stress/psychopathology), there was a strong increase in risk factors between T1 and T2, including large increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology, alongside declining socioeconomic status and reduced self-efficacy—an overall pattern highly suggestive of the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with below-average protective factors (low positive mental health, life satisfaction, self-efficacy) but also had very low risk factors (low anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and low general psychopathology). Most key psychological variables either improved or changed only slightly, with a notable decrease in dysfunctional attitudes; there is no strong evidence of new onset psychopathology between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite below-average positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction at T1, there is no evidence of increased risk by T2; in fact, protective factors (self-efficacy, life satisfaction, positive mental health) improved while psychopathology decreased, making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"Despite high risk at T1—marked by elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and psychopathology—the person actually shows improved general psychopathology and life satisfaction by T2, with no meaningful increase in risk factors and an overall decrease in GSI, suggesting they did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual already exhibited elevated risk factors and mild psychopathology at T1, along with only modest increases in dysfunctional attitudes and negligible changes in overall psychopathology (GSI) by T2, indicating the absence of a new disorder but rather a continuation of existing psychological difficulties."
0,"The individual started with a highly protective profile at T1—exceptionally high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress, very low general psychopathology, and strong social support. Although there were slight increases in risk factors and a small rise in general psychopathology at T2, there was also an improvement in positive mental health; overall, the pattern does not indicate the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there was a substantial drop in positive mental health and self-efficacy, initial T1 protective factors were exceptionally high (positive mental health and self-efficacy, low psychopathology), and current risk factor increases are moderate; social support greatly increased and general psychopathology remains only moderately elevated, so the pattern does not indicate the clear onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there are demographic risk factors (lower education and socioeconomic status) and some fluctuations in risk/protective psychological variables, the individual starts with only mild psychological distress at T1 and shows a strong increase in positive mental health at T2, without large increases in overall psychopathology or dysfunctional attitudes, indicating no substantial development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and some risk at T1 (above-average fear of bodily sensations, moderate dysfunctional attitudes), protective factors (e.g., consistently low general psychopathology, reduced anxiety sensitivity, increased social support and self-efficacy, decreased GSI at T2) outweigh risk, and there is no evidence of a new psychological disorder developing."
0,"The individual started with above-average life satisfaction, decent self-efficacy, and low psychopathology at T1, and while there was some increase in risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, general psychopathology), there were also improvements in protective factors (positive mental health, social support), and no strong or consistent movement into the risk range for any core variable—making the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2 unlikely."
0,"The individual showed strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, problem-focused and emotion-focused coping, and very low dysfunctional attitudes), and from T1 to T2, most psychological risk factors improved or remained stable (notably, GSI and dysfunctional attitudes decreased substantially while positive mental health and life satisfaction increased). Thus, it is unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite high anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes at T1 (risk factors), the individual maintains high socioeconomic status (protective), robust improvements in positive mental health and life satisfaction, and a reduction in general psychopathology at T2, all of which indicate no new psychological disorder development."
0,"Despite lower education and socioeconomic status (risk factors), the individual had strong baseline protective factors at T1, including high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and very low psychopathology. While anxiety sensitivity increased and positive mental health decreased slightly, there were no substantial rises in dysfunctional attitudes or general psychopathology, and life satisfaction actually improved considerably, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
1,"The individual started with relatively low psychopathology and average mental health at T1 but exhibited very large increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and especially overall psychological distress (GSI) by T2, all of which are strong risk factors for developing a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started with moderate mental health but very low self-efficacy, poor social support, low life satisfaction, and high emotion-focused coping (risk factors). From T1 to T2, there were large increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology (GSI), as well as notable decreases in positive mental health and social support, strongly suggesting the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with several risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low life satisfaction, high stress), but showed notable improvements in positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, along with decreases in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology; these positive changes and the lack of marked increase in risk indicators suggest no new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
1,"The person started with high stress and moderate psychopathology at T1 but experienced large declines in protective factors (self-efficacy, life satisfaction, positive mental health, and social support) and very large increases in risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and overall psychopathology) from T1 to T2, strongly suggesting the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Although baseline protective factors were mixed, there was a marked decline in positive mental health, general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, alongside substantial increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology. These dramatic changes in risk factors and distress strongly suggest the development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although general psychopathology (GSI) increased substantially, the person showed strong improvements in key protective factors (positive mental health and self-efficacy), remained low in dysfunctional attitudes, and had only mild elevations in risk factors; overall, this pattern does not definitively indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and initial high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, this individual showed marked improvements in positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction, and large decreases in key risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations over time, with only a minor increase in general psychopathology; these changes do not indicate new disorder development."
1,"The individual started with mostly protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, coping, low stress) but experienced a large decrease in positive mental health and social support, alongside a substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, which strongly suggests the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy; high dysfunctional attitudes), there are strong protective factors including high socioeconomic status and life satisfaction, low stress, and very low anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations. Although GSI (general psychopathology) and some risk markers increase notably at T2, there is no strong, consistent, across-the-board elevation in critical risk domains to clearly indicate the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual already showed very high general psychopathology (GSI) as well as elevated risk factors (high anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes) at T1, suggesting a psychological disorder was already present; additionally, psychopathology and most risk factors markedly decreased from T1 to T2, indicating no new disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite decreases in life satisfaction and self-efficacy and increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology, the person started at T1 with strong protective factors (high social support, high coping skills, low anxiety sensitivity, and low general psychopathology). The magnitude of change is not sufficient to indicate a shift from health to disorder, especially given improvements in positive mental health and only moderate increases in risk factors."
1,"The person was at elevated risk at T1 due to above-average stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology; these risk factors further worsened between T1 and T2 (notably large increases in anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology), despite gains in positive mental health and social support, indicating the likely development of a new psychological disorder by T2."
0,"Although there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology (GSI) between T1 and T2, the individual starts with low risk at T1—strong protective factors include high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support, with only slightly below-average positive mental health and elevated dysfunctional attitudes. Most key risk factors do not meaningfully deteriorate, and the pattern of change does not indicate the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual had high risk factors at T1 (notably extremely high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, along with lower socioeconomic status and general self-efficacy), the changes from T1 to T2 show substantial decreases in these key risk factors (including large reductions in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes). While there was a notable drop in positive mental health and social support, the overall profile suggests ongoing psychological difficulties rather than the onset of a new disorder after a healthy baseline."
0,"Although the individual has low socioeconomic status, education, and BMI (risk factors), their T1 profile shows already very high psychological distress and dysfunctional attitudes, indicating that a disorder was likely already present at T1; T1 to T2 changes show notable decreases in distress and dysfunctional attitudes, so there is no evidence of new disorder onset—if anything, symptoms improved."
0,"The individual showed low risk at baseline and experienced substantial improvements in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction from T1 to T2, with decreases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations. Although there is a small increase in general psychopathology, the strong rise in protective factors and reduction in key risk factors make the development of a psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"The individual started with several protective factors at T1 (high life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support, very low stress and psychopathology, low anxiety sensitivity and fear), and over time showed further decreases in risk factors (less dysfunctional attitudes, lower general psychopathology, stable or improved anxiety/fear), despite some reductions in positive mental health and life satisfaction. There is no evidence of emerging risk or substantial psychological deterioration indicative of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person exhibited extremely severe psychopathology (very high GSI, high anxiety sensitivity, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, and high stress) already at T1, indicating an existing psychological disorder, so although their symptoms changed somewhat, there is no evidence of new disorder onset between T1 and T2."
0,"The person had strong protective factors at T1 (very high general self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support, alongside low stress and low general psychopathology), and while there was a modest increase in general psychopathology at T2, major risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity) actually decreased markedly and positive mental health dramatically improved, making new disorder development highly unlikely."
0,"Although there are declines in protective factors such as positive mental health, life satisfaction, and social support from T1 to T2, the individual started at T1 with high socioeconomic status and very strong mental health (low distress, high self-efficacy, high social support, low dysfunctional attitudes) and shows decreases in several risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations). There is only a minor increase in general psychopathology, making it unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The individual began with some risk factors (low positive mental health, low social support, and low socioeconomic status), but marked increases in protective factors (life satisfaction, positive mental health, and social support) and decreases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes) by T2 indicate significant overall improvement and make new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Despite demographic risk factors (lower education and SES), the individual was psychologically healthy at T1 (low GSI, low distress) and, while they experienced a decline in social support and self-efficacy, crucial protective factors such as positive mental health and life satisfaction increased, risk factors like dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity decreased, and there was no notable increase in general psychopathology. This pattern suggests no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The person began with excellent protective factors (high education, low stress, high coping, very low baseline anxiety and fear, low psychopathology) and, despite small increases in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and dysfunction, their positive mental health, social support and life satisfaction all improved at T2 with only a modest, still subclinical increase in general psychopathology—overall, the profile does not indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low education and socioeconomic status (demographic risk factors), the person started at T1 with strong protective factors such as high life satisfaction, high social support, low anxiety sensitivity, low fear, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low general psychopathology. Although there were increases in general psychopathology and losses in life satisfaction and positive mental health over time, there was a substantial increase in self-efficacy and social support, with overall risk/protective factor balance not suggesting the emergence of a new disorder."
0,"The person exhibited extremely high risk at T1 with very poor socioeconomic status, low protective factors (e.g., extremely low social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction), and severe psychopathology (high GSI). However, substantial improvements occurred between T1 and T2 in nearly all risk and protective factors—including a large reduction in general psychopathology—indicating recovery or ongoing disorder, not the new onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although this individual had high risk at T1 (elevated stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and psychopathology), most risk factors and psychopathology markedly decreased at T2, with substantial reductions in GSI, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy; there is no evidence of new disorder development between T1 (when the person likely already had a disorder) and T2."
0,"Despite an increase in general psychopathology (GSI), this individual started at T1 with several protective factors including high socioeconomic status, very low stress, and low anxiety sensitivity, and showed large improvements in life satisfaction, social support, and positive mental health by T2—suggesting positive adaptation rather than the onset of a new disorder."
1,"The individual started at T1 with low socioeconomic status, education, and several strong psychological risk factors (low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, elevated anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes). From T1 to T2, risk factors increased further (notably, large increases in dysfunctional attitudes, GSI, and fear of bodily sensations), all indicating a substantial rise in psychopathology consistent with new disorder onset."
1,"The individual began with relatively low positive mental health, high dysfunctional attitudes, and low stress at T1 (suggesting no disorder but some risk). At T2, strong risk factors emerged: sharp increases in general psychopathology (GSI), anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations, along with a marked drop in social support, indicating the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"While this person showed several risk factors at T1, including low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, lower life satisfaction, and elevated general psychopathology, their psychological health improved by T2: there were substantial decreases in psychopathological symptoms (GSI), increased self-efficacy and life satisfaction, and reduced fear of bodily sensations. These patterns are inconsistent with the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started with robust protective factors at T1, including high life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy, low psychopathology, and low dysfunctional attitudes; these factors improved or remained stable over time with only minor increases in risk variables, making the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2 unlikely."
0,"Although there is a substantial increase in anxiety sensitivity and a slight increase in general psychopathology, the individual shows very large improvements in positive mental health, life satisfaction, and maintains high social support. The net balance of strong increased protective factors (especially recovery from extremely low life satisfaction and positive mental health) outweighs the rise in risk factors, and there is no clear pattern suggesting the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, below-average self-efficacy), but had high life satisfaction, low stress, and low general psychopathology. From T1 to T2, protective factors like positive mental health and self-efficacy actually improved, dysfunctional attitudes decreased substantially, and general psychopathology remained nearly unchanged, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"The person already exhibited extremely high general psychopathology and multiple risk factors (high stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and low socioeconomic status) at T1, implying an ongoing disorder rather than new onset. By T2, substantial improvements are evident (large decrease in GSI, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes), indicating recovery or ongoing symptoms rather than development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a significant decrease in life satisfaction and positive mental health, the individual started with strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and low risk factors such as low anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes) at T1, and shows no notable increase in general psychopathology or core risk factors at T2, indicating no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite very low socioeconomic status, education, and BMI (risk factors), the individual started with extremely high protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) and, although their positive mental health and social support dropped sharply, their anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations decreased dramatically and psychopathology symptoms actually decreased. There is no indication that the person developed a new psychological disorder by T2."
0,"Although there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology and a notable decrease in general self-efficacy from T1 to T2, the individual started with low psychopathology, low anxiety sensitivity, and only mildly negative baseline protective factors; the changes do not suggest the onset of a new psychological disorder, but rather some increased distress within a still subclinical range."
0,"The individual started with some risk factors—low socioeconomic status and below-average positive mental health and social support—but also had strong protective factors like high self-efficacy, problem-focused coping, low dysfunctional attitudes, and relatively low psychopathology at T1. Between T1 and T2, key protective variables improved, most notably social support and positive mental health, while risk variables like anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology all decreased; despite the drop in self-efficacy, the overall trend points towards improved or stable mental health, making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"The individual starts with moderately low positive mental health and social support at T1, but high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and very low psychopathology and risk factors. By T2, all protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) increase, and psychopathology remains low, indicating no evidence of new psychological disorder development."
1,"Although the person started with strong protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health, self-efficacy, and socioeconomic status), there was a substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI) between T1 and T2, as well as a dramatic rise in fear of bodily sensations, both of which are pronounced risk factors for developing a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a notable drop in life satisfaction and a slight increase in general psychopathology at T2, this individual began with strong protective factors (high social support, low distress, and good coping), and most risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) actually decreased. There is no compelling shift toward high risk or distress levels to suggest a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and education, the person began with high positive mental health, high social support, low stress, and low general psychopathology, and experienced decreases in risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations) and no meaningful increases in distress at T2; these patterns indicate stable or improved mental health rather than the onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although this individual started with some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low life satisfaction, elevated anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes), their protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, problem-focused coping) were also above average. From T1 to T2, positive mental health and life satisfaction increased, dysfunctional attitudes decreased, and GSI rose moderately but not to clinically concerning levels; on balance, these patterns do not clearly indicate the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite decreases in self-efficacy and life satisfaction and a modest rise in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity, the individual began with very strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, low psychopathology, very low anxiety sensitivity, fear, and dysfunctional attitudes). The increases in risk factors and symptoms do not reach a magnitude or pattern suggestive of new disorder onset; rather, the individual remains within a broadly healthy range."
1,"The person started with low positive mental health and extremely low self-efficacy, and although their baseline stress and psychopathology were low, they experienced a pronounced drop in social support and life satisfaction, as well as a substantial increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology by T2. These significant negative changes in both risk and protective factors strongly suggest development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"This individual started at T1 with strong protective factors (very high life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support, and low psychopathology/risk factors), and although several protective factors (like life satisfaction and self-efficacy) declined substantially by T2 and some risk factors rose, their absolute scores likely remained within the healthy range. The observed changes do not indicate sufficient shift to suggest the clear development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual already exhibited severe psychopathology and high risk factors at T1 (very high GSI, stress, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, low positive mental health and self-efficacy), but by T2 showed marked improvements across nearly all domains, including a dramatic reduction in overall psychopathology and increases in protective factors, suggesting no new disorder developed."
0,"The person had several protective factors at T1 (high life satisfaction, low stress, average-to-high self-efficacy), and while some risk factors (low positive mental health, high fear of bodily sensations) were present, the T1-to-T2 changes (improved social support and self-efficacy, reduced fear and GSI) suggest greater resilience and no emergence of significant psychopathology. Thus, there is no evidence that a new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite risk factors at baseline such as low socioeconomic status, high stress, and low life satisfaction, the decreases in general psychopathology (GSI), anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations between T1 and T2 suggest an overall improvement in mental health, while key risk indicators for new disorder development (like GSI) actually improve and protective factors (e.g., life satisfaction) rebound; thus, the individual did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual's T1 profile is highly protected (low psychopathology, high social support, low risk factors), and changes to T2 show only minor increases in general psychopathology and slight decreases in some protective factors, with no evidence of marked risk elevation or loss of functioning sufficient for new disorder onset."
0,"Despite high baseline stress and anxiety sensitivity at T1, there are several protective factors including above-average social support and life satisfaction, with improvements across most measures (increased self-efficacy and life satisfaction, reduced anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes) and only a minimal increase in general psychopathology. This pattern suggests resilience and adjustment rather than new disorder onset."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and BMI, the individual at T1 exhibited strong protective factors (high life satisfaction, social support, low stress), and T2 saw further increases in self-efficacy and life satisfaction with notable reductions in key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, GSI), suggesting they did not develop a psychological disorder."
1,"Despite having some initial protective factors at T1 (higher social support, self-efficacy, low stress), the person experienced very large increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations from T1 to T2, both strong risk factors for developing a psychological disorder. The simultaneous drop in positive mental health, social support, and persistence of moderate dysfunctional attitudes further supports the likelihood of new disorder onset."
0,"Although there is an increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology with a decrease in social support and self-efficacy, the person already exhibited notably high general psychopathology at T1 (likely indicating a pre-existing disorder). Thus, the pattern reflects ongoing difficulties rather than the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although the individual showed severe psychological distress and multiple risk factors at T1 (very low well-being, life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy, and high dysfunctional attitudes and psychopathology), these issues were already present at baseline. Subsequent improvements in protective factors and reductions in general psychopathology between T1 and T2 suggest stabilization or partial recovery, rather than the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although some risk factors increased (notably GSI and dysfunctional attitudes), there was a substantial increase in positive mental health and no dramatic rise in core risk indicators like anxiety sensitivity or general psychopathology relative to baseline; thus, there is no clear pattern suggesting the onset of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"Despite strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, positive mental health) and a reduction in some risk factors (lowered anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes at T2), there is a large increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, suggesting the emergence of clinically significant psychological symptoms consistent with the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The person had substantial mental health risk factors and already showed elevated general psychopathology and stress at T1, indicating an ongoing or pre-existing psychological disorder rather than a new-onset disorder between T1 and T2. While some risk factors worsened (e.g., general psychopathology, fear of bodily sensations, loss of social support), this represents continuation or escalation rather than the development of a new disorder in someone who was previously healthy."
0,"The individual started with high protective factors (self-efficacy, positive mental health, social support, and coping skills) and, although initially elevated in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes), all key risk factors decreased substantially from T1 to T2, with no significant rise in general psychopathology; this overall pattern suggests no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person displays high protective demographic factors (education, SES), and at T1 had moderate risk due to low positive mental health but strong protective factors overall (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress/distress, low anxiety sensitivity). From T1 to T2, most protective factors increase markedly (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction), psychopathology does not increase, despite a spike in dysfunctional attitudes—on balance, the pattern suggests increased resilience and no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite several risk factors at T1 (low education, very low social support, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, elevated dysfunctional attitudes, and mild baseline psychopathology), the person’s protective factors—especially a strong improvement in positive mental health and life satisfaction, with a decrease in overall psychopathology—suggest they did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person shows substantial improvements in protective factors and notable decreases in key risk factors from T1 to T2: large reductions in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology, along with increases in positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction. This pattern strongly suggests recovery from psychological distress rather than the development of a new disorder."
0,"The individual already presented significant psychological distress and signs of psychopathology at T1 (high GSI, stress, low life satisfaction, low self-efficacy), indicating an ongoing disorder rather than developing a new disorder in the interval; while some risk factors increased, the lack of transition from health to disorder means no new disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started with a healthy psychological profile at T1—low distress, low risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes), and moderately positive protective factors, despite low social support and coping. Although protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy) slightly decreased and psychopathology increased marginally at T2, risk factors remained low and social support sharply increased, suggesting no evidence of a new psychological disorder developing."
0,"The person had very strong protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress, and low psychopathology) and, although there were moderate declines in positive mental health and self-efficacy and a small increase in psychopathology by T2, most risk factors remained low and several protective factors actually improved (e.g., life satisfaction increased). There is no clear evidence of new psychological disorder development."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and elevated risk factors at T1 (high general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and low social support), all protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support) strongly improved and general psychopathology significantly decreased by T2, indicating recovery rather than new disorder onset."
0,"The individual showed marked improvements in life satisfaction, social support, positive mental health, a decrease in dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and a significant reduction in general psychopathology from T1 to T2, indicating recovery or stabilization rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors (high education, SES, self-efficacy, problem-focused coping, and low baseline psychopathology) and showed improvements in general self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction over time. Despite a moderate increase in general psychopathology, the overall pattern is not indicative of new disorder development, as risk remains low and protective factors increased."
0,"Although positive mental health decreases and both anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes increase between T1 and T2, the individual shows strong protective demographic factors (high socioeconomic status), an increase in general self-efficacy, stable or improved social support, and a decrease in general psychopathology. These protective changes outweigh the risk factor increases, making new disorder development unlikely."
1,"Despite some improvements in positive mental health and a drop in dysfunctional attitudes, the person started with low protective factors (especially education, SES, and positive mental health at T1) and experienced dramatic increases in risk factors between T1 and T2: a substantial loss of social support and self-efficacy, major declines in life satisfaction, and a very large rise in overall psychological distress (GSI), making the development of a new psychological disorder highly likely."
0,"Although socioeconomic status is a risk factor, the person already had low positive mental health and life satisfaction, low self-efficacy, and slightly elevated dysfunctional attitudes at T1 (indicating preexisting vulnerability), but general psychopathology was low and there was no significant worsening between T1 and T2. In fact, most key risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, GSI) decreased, and protective factors such as life satisfaction and positive mental health improved, making the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2 unlikely."
0,"Although there is a noticeable decline in protective factors like social support and self-efficacy and marked increases in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and overall psychopathology from T1 to T2, the individual already showed elevated general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes at T1, indicating the likely presence of ongoing psychological difficulties rather than a new onset. There is no evidence the individual was psychologically healthy at T1, so there is no clear indication of a new disorder developing between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low social support and elevated anxiety sensitivity at T1, there is a strong increase in protective factors from T1 to T2, such as social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, while risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, GSI) decrease; this pattern does not suggest the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started with robust protective factors (high social support, positive mental health, good socioeconomic status) but showed sharp declines in life satisfaction, positive mental health, self-efficacy, and social support—while risk factors like dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology increased. This shift from a stable to a deteriorating psychological profile indicates likely development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite a moderate increase in general psychopathology and some loss of social support from T1 to T2, the individual started with a highly protective profile (low distress, high life satisfaction, strong self-efficacy, social support, and very low risk factors) and did not show a sufficient increase in risk or psychopathology to suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual starts with some psychological vulnerability (low positive mental health, high stress, low self-efficacy) but also strong protective factors (very high life satisfaction, high social support, low GSI), and their risk factors generally improve or remain stable over time (e.g., positive mental health and self-efficacy increase, dysfunctional attitudes and fear of bodily sensations decrease). Although there is a modest increase in general psychopathology and a decline in life satisfaction, these changes are not of a magnitude or direction to indicate the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some demographic risk (lower education and socioeconomic status) and a decrease in protective factors (self-efficacy, social support), the person’s baseline at T1 was strongly psychologically healthy—with very low risk factors, strong protective factors, and extremely low psychopathology—and although some risk factors have increased (notably dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and GSI), the overall changes are moderate, and their protective factors mostly remain above average. Therefore, while their mental health appears to have somewhat deteriorated, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude a new psychological disorder developed by T2."
0,"The person showed strong protective factors at T1 (high life satisfaction, social support, and self-efficacy; low stress; low psychopathology), and between T1 and T2, key risk factors either decreased or remained stable (dysfunctional attitudes and GSI both decreased; negative change in self-efficacy and life satisfaction is moderate but not extreme). There is no indication of a marked increase in risk, so it is unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Although the individual had some risk factors at T1 (elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes; low social support), their positive mental health was very high, and distress was low. Between T1 and T2, key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) markedly decreased, and general psychopathology also declined, arguing strongly against the onset of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started with high protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress), but showed large declines in these protective factors and substantial increases in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology from T1 to T2, indicating the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"While there are demographic risk factors (lower education and socioeconomic status, higher BMI) and a decrease in life satisfaction alongside a small increase in overall psychopathology, the individual's baseline was not psychologically healthy but rather already slightly distressed (GSI slightly above average at T1, moderate anxiety sensitivity and fear). Most risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes) actually decreased, and protective factors (self-efficacy, positive mental health) increased or remained stable, making it unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"The person showed no elevated general psychopathology at T1 and actually experienced a decrease in overall psychological distress (GSI) at T2, alongside increased self-efficacy and life satisfaction; although they had high dysfunctional attitudes and moderate social support at T1, the net pattern reflects improved or stable protective factors and no substantial increase in risk, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The person started with strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes), and despite low socioeconomic status and some reduction in self-efficacy, there was actually a mild increase in positive mental health while overall risk factors remained low and GSI did not meaningfully increase. There is no clear pattern indicating the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, social support, problem- and emotion-focused coping, and very low dysfunctional attitudes and psychopathology), and most changes between T1 and T2 were stable or improved, with no major increases in risk factors or overall psychopathology, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some increased risk in general psychopathology and large drops in social support and life satisfaction at T2, the person started with average-to-low psychological risk at T1, demonstrated significant increases in positive mental health and self-efficacy (protective factors), and did not show substantial spikes in major risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) that would suggest onset of a new disorder."
0,"Although the individual experienced decreases in protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and a slight increase in general psychopathology, the T1 baseline already featured moderate stress and mildly elevated dysfunctional attitudes, suggesting some ongoing risk rather than new disorder onset. There is no clear evidence of transition from a psychologically healthy state to a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status, the individual had strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy and life satisfaction, low anxiety sensitivity/fear/dysfunctional attitudes, low psychopathology), and although there was a notable drop in self-efficacy and a rise in dysfunctional attitudes and fear, positive mental health and social support increased, and general psychopathology decreased from T1 to T2; overall there is no clear pattern indicating the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual’s baseline T1 profile shows already elevated risk for disorder (high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, low positive mental health and self-efficacy), and there is a large spike in general psychopathology (GSI) at T2, alongside increases in dysfunctional attitudes and decreased life satisfaction, all indicating the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite a significant drop in positive mental health and a marked increase in the fear of bodily sensations, protective factors such as increased social support and self-efficacy, along with reductions in dysfunctional attitudes and stable (slightly reduced) general psychopathology, suggest no clear emergence of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although baseline at T1 showed significant psychological distress and poor mental health, from T1 to T2 the individual experienced substantial improvements in positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and a large reduction in overall psychopathology, indicating recovery rather than new disorder onset."
0,"Although the individual had high initial risk factors (high stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology at T1) and low protective factors (low education, low socioeconomic status, low self-efficacy, low social support), these elevated symptoms and general distress were already present at T1, indicating possible ongoing psychopathology rather than a new onset. There are no signs the person was healthy at T1, so this is not a new case of disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"The person had some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health and life satisfaction) but showed clear improvement across almost all protective factors (notably, strong increases in life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy, and positive mental health) and a strong decrease in dysfunctional attitudes from T1 to T2. Despite a slight rise in general psychopathology, the overall pattern is of increasing resilience and wellbeing, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"The individual started with overall low risk (good life satisfaction, low GSI, low stress, above-average social support, and some risk via low problem-focused coping and slightly elevated dysfunctional attitudes). Positive mental health, general self-efficacy, and GSI worsened only slightly from T1 to T2, but most risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) actually decreased or improved, and no substantial, consistent increase in key risk variables is present; therefore, there is insufficient evidence for a new psychological disorder having developed."
0,"Although the individual displayed very high psychopathological distress at T1 and several risk factors (such as high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, stress, dysfunctional attitudes, and low life satisfaction), there is substantial improvement between T1 and T2: notably, GSI, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations all decrease markedly, while life satisfaction and self-efficacy increase. This pattern strongly suggests ongoing recovery or remission rather than the development of a new disorder."
0,"Despite low education and socioeconomic status (risk factors), the individual started with strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, positive mental health, low psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and fear), and although there was a significant decline in protective factors and a moderate increase in general psychopathology, the GSI at T2 likely remains below the threshold for a new disorder. There is no indication of a strong enough increase in risk factors or overall distress to suggest the new onset of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The person was psychologically healthy at T1 with low distress, high self-efficacy, and low anxiety sensitivity, but from T1 to T2 experienced a marked decrease in self-efficacy, very large increase in general psychopathology and anxiety sensitivity, while social support dramatically decreased; these changes in risk factors and protective factors together strongly indicate new disorder development."
0,"The individual had extremely high psychopathology and risk factors at T1, indicating an existing psychological disorder at baseline; despite significant improvements in most risk variables and a large decrease in psychopathology at T2, there is no evidence of new disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there is a notable increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, the individual already showed several baseline risk factors at T1 (e.g., low positive mental health, high stress, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes), indicating the possible presence of ongoing psychological problems rather than new onset. The improvements in positive mental health and life satisfaction, along with the absence of a new pattern of emerging risk factors, suggest the absence of a new psychological disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"Although this individual had several risk factors at T1 (very low social support, low life satisfaction, elevated dysfunctional attitudes, and above-average psychopathology), their T2 showed strong improvements in protective factors like positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; the marked increase in general psychopathology may reflect an ongoing or worsening issue rather than the development of a new disorder, meaning no new disorder emerged between T1 and T2."
1,"Although there were strong protective factors at T1 such as high social support, low stress, and low general psychopathology, the individual already exhibited risk factors (below average positive mental health, low self-efficacy, high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations). Critically, from T1 to T2, there were very large increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations—both prominent risk factors—pointing to the likely onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with high risk factors (high stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations) but had strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, coping). Between T1 and T2, risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes) decreased substantially, and while there was an increase in general psychopathology and a drop in life satisfaction, there is not enough consistent evidence to indicate the new development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The person starts with strong protective factors at T1, including high life satisfaction, social support, and socioeconomic status, and does not show marked increases in core risk factors or overall psychopathology from T1 to T2; in fact, general psychopathology decreases, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1 (very high positive mental health and social support, low stress, and low psychopathology), and these further improved by T2 (notable increases in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction). Although socioeconomic status is lower and general psychopathology increased somewhat, there is no substantial rise in risk factors or drop in protective factors to suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person began with only mildly elevated risk (slightly low positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, but low stress, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low GSI indicate psychological health at T1). While anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations increased by T2, protective factors such as positive mental health, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy improved substantially, and overall psychopathology remained below average. There is no strong pattern suggesting the new onset of a psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started with elevated stress, low life satisfaction, and some dysfunctional attitudes, but with no apparent disorder. Between T1 and T2, there were striking increases in risk factors—general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes—and a significant loss of social support, indicating the likely development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with low socioeconomic status and low positive mental health, but had strong protective factors including high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with very low initial psychopathology and risk factors. All core protective factors substantially increased from T1 to T2, while risk factors and general psychopathology remained low, indicating no development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low education, high BMI, and low socioeconomic status as demographic risk factors, the individual’s T1 mental health was robust (very low psychopathology, stress, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations, plus high life satisfaction and self-efficacy). Changes to T2 included increased social support and stable or only slightly increased risk factors, with low overall magnitude of negative change—there’s no evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite declines in protective factors such as positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy from T1 to T2, risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations actually decreased, and the increase in general psychopathology was minor. The person started with a robust psychological profile, and the overall changes do not point to the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status (risk factor) and a significant drop in positive mental health and social support, the individual started with very strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, low dysfunctional attitudes, low psychopathology), and by T2, risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology all markedly decreased, making it unlikely a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The individual began with notably poor social support and low positive mental health but showed substantial improvements in both between T1 and T2, while risk factors such as general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes increased modestly but did not reach extreme levels; overall, the protective improvements coupled with a low baseline risk suggest no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although some risk factors were present at T1 (elevated stress, average psychopathology, slightly high dysfunctional attitudes), there are significant protective factors (high education, strong social support, increases in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes) do not worsen from T1 to T2, with general psychopathology actually decreasing, which all indicate no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a low baseline positive mental health, this individual displayed strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, coping, social support, and low psychopathology), and while some risk factors increased (dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, GSI), there was a marked increase in positive mental health and life satisfaction at T2, suggesting overall psychological resilience and no clear pattern indicating the onset of a new disorder."
0,"Despite the person starting with several risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, extremely low social support, moderate distress, and high psychopathology), T2 shows large increases in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and large decreases in general psychopathology, suggesting substantial psychological improvement rather than the onset of a new disorder."
0,"The individual started with generally healthy psychological functioning at T1, including good social support, self-efficacy, and notably low dysfunctional attitudes, with only moderately elevated stress. By T2, protective factors such as self-efficacy and positive mental health improved, risk factors like anxiety sensitivity decreased, and there was no meaningful increase in overall psychopathology or dysfunctional attitudes—suggesting no development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite demographic risk factors (lower education, higher BMI, and lower socioeconomic status), the individual started without any psychological disorder and showed strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, low general psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, very low anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations). Over time, self-efficacy and life satisfaction improved significantly while risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) decreased further and general psychopathology remained stable, suggesting no development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status, education, and some elevated risk factors at T1 (such as high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), key indicators like general psychopathology remain average or improve slightly over time. Furthermore, there are improvements or stability in protective factors (e.g., positive mental health and life satisfaction both increase), and substantial decreases in risk factors (notably anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes decrease over time), suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"Although socioeconomic status is a protective factor, the individual started with low positive mental health, high stress, very high dysfunctional attitudes, and moderate risk in other areas. From T1 to T2, general psychopathology (GSI) increased substantially, life satisfaction declined, self-efficacy decreased, and fear of bodily sensations rose sharply—strongly suggesting new onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite very high initial stress and low problem-focused coping at T1, the individual shows substantial increases in protective factors such as social support, general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction from T1 to T2, along with marked decreases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology, all suggesting improved well-being rather than the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual showed average to above-average protective factors at T1 (e.g., self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress), and notably improved on key protective factors at T2 (increased positive mental health, increased social support, and a strong reduction in dysfunctional attitudes), despite a moderate increase in general psychopathology; the baseline risk was low, and overall the pattern does not suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with low positive mental health, high stress, and low life satisfaction (baseline risks) but demonstrated improved positive mental health and life satisfaction over time; while general self-efficacy and social support decreased, and general psychopathology increased slightly, overall risk factors did not intensify to a level strongly suggesting new disorder onset, and baseline functioning was already subclinical."
1,"Despite high education and strong initial positive mental health, very low socioeconomic status at baseline, high anxiety sensitivity, and an almost 1-standard deviation increase in general psychopathology between T1 and T2—along with pronounced drops in protective factors like self-efficacy, positive mental health, and social support—indicate the development of a psychological disorder at T2."
0,"The individual starts with strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and low stress) despite elevated risk factors (high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), but from T1 to T2, both protective and risk factors decline along with slightly reduced psychological distress; however, there is no meaningful increase in general psychopathology (GSI), indicating they do not meet criteria for developing a new disorder."
0,"Although this individual had highly elevated risk factors at T1 (very low social support, high stress, high anxiety sensitivity, high dysfunctional attitudes, and significant psychopathology), their profile improved markedly between T1 and T2, with large reductions in general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes, and strong increases in protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction). This pattern is consistent with recovery or significant improvement, not the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some negative changes—such as a large drop in positive mental health and further declines in social support and self-efficacy—the individual already showed significant psychological risk at T1 (high stress, low social support, high GSI, dysfunctional attitudes), suggesting a pre-existing disorder rather than the development of a new one between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual started with a fairly healthy psychological profile at T1, with strong self-efficacy and low dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear. However, between T1 and T2, there were extreme increases in multiple key risk factors—general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes—all of which strongly suggest the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite the person’s low education (risk factor), their T1 profile indicates positive protective factors (above-average social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with low stress/psychopathology), and from T1 to T2 there are improved protective factors (increased self-efficacy and life satisfaction, decreased dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations, anxiety sensitivity, and GSI). Though positive mental health declines, the robust improvements in other measures suggest no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The individual had significant psychological difficulties at T1, including high psychopathology, fear of bodily sensations, and anxiety sensitivity, but showed substantial protective changes by T2, such as marked increases in positive mental health and life satisfaction and a notable decrease in overall psychopathology, indicating either stable ongoing disorder or recovery, not new onset."
0,"The individual started with some elevated risk factors (moderate anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), but there is a substantial decrease in general psychopathology (GSI), anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations between T1 and T2, along with no increases in distress or dysfunction; thus, there is no evidence of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there are large increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations—both risk factors—the individual started with substantially below-average risk on all psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, high life satisfaction, and very low stress. Their positive mental health increases considerably, life satisfaction improves, and their GSI puts them well below average overall distress at T1 with almost no increase by T2, so there is no strong evidence for new psychological disorder onset."
1,"The individual starts with a healthy psychological profile at T1 (low general psychopathology, low stress, and strong protective factors like social support and life satisfaction), but shows marked increases in key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology) and decreases in important protective factors (life satisfaction, social support) by T2, strongly suggesting the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the person had high risk factors at T1 (notably elevated stress, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations, with only mildly elevated psychopathology), their overall mental health, social support, and life satisfaction were protective, and general psychopathology actually decreased slightly by T2. Despite moderate declines in positive mental health and coping, the absence of a substantial general psychopathology increase suggests no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"While some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, slightly low social support, and low life satisfaction) are present, overall baseline psychopathology is low, self-efficacy is above average, and there is a clear increase in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction) from T1 to T2. The moderate increase in GSI remains within normal variation and does not suggest the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person exhibited severe psychological distress and multiple risk factors already at T1 (high GSI, stress, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, low life satisfaction, low self-efficacy, low SES), indicating they were not healthy at baseline; no new disorder was developed between T1 and T2."
0,"The person started with several protective factors (low stress, high self-efficacy, high life satisfaction, high socioeconomic status) despite some risk factors (low positive mental health, low social support, elevated anxiety sensitivity). Between T1 and T2, nearly all protective factors improved (increases in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and risk factors decreased or only slightly worsened, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started off with relatively good protective factors (especially high life satisfaction and social support, and low psychopathology at T1) but showed a large increase in general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes from T1 to T2, alongside a substantial decrease in self-efficacy and an increase in risk indicators—suggesting the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with low risk at T1 (low distress, high coping, low anxiety/fear, low dysfunctional attitudes), and although there was a slight increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology at T2, protective factors like improved positive mental health and stable social support remain, and no significant overall risk increase suggests the development of a new disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors (low socioeconomic status, very high baseline psychopathology, low self-efficacy, and poor coping), this individual already showed strong psychological disorder indicators at T1. Most risk factors improved or remained stable by T2 (notably, a very large decrease in general psychopathology), with no indications of new disorder onset, thus no new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual began with relatively low positive mental health and high stress at T1, but also exhibited strong protective factors such as high social support, self-efficacy, problem-focused coping, and low risk factors like anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI. From T1 to T2, most changes were mildly positive or stable (including a decrease in psychopathology and increases in positive mental health and self-efficacy), with no substantial rise in risk factors, indicating no development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had significant risk factors and likely an ongoing psychological disorder at T1 (very high GSI and dysfunctional attitudes, high stress, low life satisfaction and social support). While some symptoms (e.g., social support, life satisfaction) improved by T2, and dysfunctional attitudes fell sharply (a strong protective shift), the data most consistently indicate an existing disorder at T1 rather than the emergence of a new one at T2."
0,"Despite a sharp decline in positive mental health and increases in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology from T1 to T2, the person started with high positive mental health, low psychopathology, and strong coping skills at T1, and there were increases in protective factors such as life satisfaction and social support at T2. The overall balance of risk and protective factors suggests that the individual did not develop a psychological disorder during this interval."
0,"The individual exhibited high general psychopathology (GSI), dysfunctional attitudes, and fear of bodily sensations at T1—clear signs of existing psychopathology. Although several protective factors and risk factors improved by T2 (including a substantial decline in GSI), these patterns suggest the person did not develop a new disorder between T1 and T2 but rather remained clinically affected or showed recovery."
0,"Despite the individual’s extremely poor baseline mental health at T1 (high risk for disorder, but likely already present), their functioning improves substantially by T2, with marked increases in protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) and reductions in risk (dysfunctional attitudes, GSI). This pattern strongly suggests recovery or ongoing disorder, not the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person began with numerous risk factors for psychological disorder at T1 (low self-efficacy, low social support, high anxiety sensitivity, high fear of bodily sensations, high dysfunctional attitudes, and low socioeconomic status), but their mental health indicators and key risk factors substantially improved by T2 (notably large increases in self-efficacy and social support, and substantial reductions in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes). Despite a modest increase in general psychopathology, the strong improvements in protective factors and reductions in risk factors suggest they did not develop a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person already exhibited notable psychological distress and maladaptive attitudes at T1, suggesting an ongoing disorder rather than the development of a new one at T2; improvements in general psychopathology and protective factors, despite some decreased social support and life satisfaction, indicate recovery or persistence rather than new onset."
0,"Despite substantial risk factors at T1 (notably high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), there is no evidence for the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2 because the individual was already presenting notable psychopathology at T1 and did not start from a healthy baseline. The changes, though concerning (e.g., increased GSI, dysfunctional attitudes), indicate either a persistence or worsening of ongoing psychopathology rather than the emergence of a new disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and very low positive mental health at T1, the individual exhibited substantial protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress, low dysfunctional attitudes) and very few risk factors at baseline. From T1 to T2, risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, drop in self-efficacy, life satisfaction) did increase somewhat, but positive mental health improved, key risk factors (e.g., fear of bodily sensations, GSI, dysfunctional attitudes) decreased, and there is no significant elevation in distress—making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"Although the individual started with some elevated risk factors (high dysfunctional attitudes, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, low social support, and elevated GSI), there is no significant increase in risk factors or psychopathology between T1 and T2; in fact, general psychopathology decreased substantially and life satisfaction increased, which suggests no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Although the person started with low protective factors (negative mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and high dysfunctional attitudes and psychopathology, their general psychopathology (GSI) decreased substantially from T1 to T2, along with reductions in dysfunctional attitudes and fear of bodily sensations. These suggest recovery or improvement rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction; low stress and psychopathology), and although there are modest increases in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology at T2, the overall levels and changes are not large enough to suggest the development of a new disorder. Positive mental health actually improved, and risk factors decreased or remained mild, indicating ongoing psychological resilience."
0,"The individual begins with strong protective factors—exceptionally high positive mental health, adequate social support, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low psychological distress—while most risk factors at T1 are moderate or low. Although there is a notable increase in general psychopathology at T2, core protective factors like positive mental health and self-efficacy actually strengthen over time, and there is not enough evidence of the magnitude or pattern of change needed to indicate the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although general psychopathology (GSI) increased notably and some baseline risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) were elevated at T1, strong protective factors at baseline (high social support, positive mental health, problem-focused coping) further improved over time (especially a large increase in positive mental health and life satisfaction), which likely buffered against the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a marked decline in positive mental health and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, the individual started with exceptionally high protective factors (e.g., positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support, problem- and emotion-focused coping, socioeconomic status), and their general psychopathology (GSI) notably decreased, with risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes also decreasing or remaining low. There is insufficient evidence of new-onset psychopathology, as overall risk remains low and key protective factors, although diminished, are still present."
0,"While the individual started with multiple risk factors at T1 (low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, high anxiety sensitivity, high fear of bodily sensations, and somewhat elevated dysfunctional attitudes), all key clinical indicators improved between T1 and T2 (increases in positive mental health, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy; decreases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), with only moderate increases in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology. There is no strong pattern indicating the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with slightly below average self-efficacy and life satisfaction, but had low risk factors (low anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology). From T1 to T2, most protective and risk factors stayed stable or improved, and general psychopathology decreased further, making it unlikely they developed a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual shows mostly stable and even slightly improved psychological functioning (increased positive mental health, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy; minimal change in overall psychopathology), with no substantial increases in major risk factors or overall psychological distress between T1 and T2, making it unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed during this interval."
1,"Although the individual started with moderate protective factors (high social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and low psychopathology and stress), there are large increases in key risk factors between T1 and T2—most notably in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology—suggesting the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with some mild risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health and life satisfaction, low coping skills, mildly elevated psychopathology), but had strong protective factors (high social support, low dysfunctional attitudes, low stress, low anxiety/fear). Over time, protective factors strengthened (increases in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; decrease in general psychopathology), and no risk factors increased substantially, indicating no new disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual shows mainly protective factors at T1 (good self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low psychopathology), and even though some risk factors increase moderately (notably, anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), overall psychological distress (GSI) rises only minimally and remains low, while important protective factors like social support and life satisfaction improve, indicating no clear development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had above-average socioeconomic status and education (protective), moderate social support, self-efficacy, and problem-focused coping at T1. While some risk factors at T1 were elevated (notably anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), their overall psychopathology (GSI) was only mildly elevated and actually decreased substantially by T2; other protective factors only declined modestly, and there were no strong increases in key risk indicators. The profile suggests no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite increased dysfunctional attitudes and a large drop in positive mental health, there are no major increases in risk factors such as general psychopathology or anxiety sensitivity, and life satisfaction dramatically improved at T2. The individual starts with relatively mild psychopathology and does not show a pattern consistent with new disorder onset."
0,"The individual already displayed some psychological distress at T1 (above-average GSI), with low positive mental health and social support, but from T1 to T2, strong increases in protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support) and sharp reductions in both risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes) and distress (GSI) point to a marked improvement, making the development of a new disorder highly unlikely."
0,"Despite a slight increase in general psychopathology, the individual started with strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, problem-focused coping, and low risk factors such as low stress, anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes). Deteriorations between T1 and T2 are present but not of sufficient magnitude or direction to indicate the onset of a new psychological disorder, especially given ongoing maintenance of multiple strong baseline protective factors."
0,"Despite an increase in general psychopathology (GSI) at T2, protective changes such as a strong increase in life satisfaction and marked decreases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes (all risk factors) indicate improvement in several core areas. Given the absence of substantial risk at T1 and the overall improvement or stability in critical domains, there is no strong evidence for new onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual already exhibited extremely high psychopathology and risk factors at T1 (not healthy at baseline), but showed substantial improvements by T2 in most domains (notably large decreases in GSI and dysfunctional attitudes, with increases in self-efficacy and life satisfaction), suggesting recovery rather than the development of a new disorder."
0,"Despite high baseline risk (high GSI, stress, low social support/self-efficacy, and elevated dysfunctional attitudes at T1), the person shows dramatic decreases in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, plus improved self-efficacy and social support by T2—suggesting recovery rather than new onset; thus, no new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low baseline mental health, social support, and life satisfaction at T1, all core protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support) improved notably by T2, with only a modest increase in risk factors and general psychopathology that remained low; there is no compelling evidence of new psychological disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"Although this individual begins with multiple demographic risk factors (low education, BMI, and socioeconomic status), their T1 protective factors (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, strong coping skills, low stress, low anxiety sensitivity, and highly functional attitudes) outweigh the moderately elevated baseline general psychopathology. At T2, improvements in positive mental health and social support, coupled with a significant drop in general psychopathology and only modest increases in risk indicators, suggest no new psychological disorder developed—in fact, overall psychological functioning improved."
0,"Although the person was at risk at T1 with high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, they showed large decreases in these risk factors and significant increases in protective factors (positive mental health and self-efficacy) by T2, making the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2 unlikely."
0,"The person already exhibited substantial psychological distress and risk factors at T1 (very high GSI, poor life satisfaction, low self-efficacy, high stress, and dysfunctional attitudes), indicating the presence of a disorder at baseline; thus, there is no evidence of developing a new disorder between T1 and T2 despite some worsening and improvement in specific symptoms."
0,"Despite initial high stress and low positive mental health at T1, the individual’s risk factors (elevated stress, low coping) are offset by strong protective factors like high life satisfaction, social support, and low psychopathology. Although there are modest increases in risk between T1 and T2—such as decreased self-efficacy and life satisfaction—there is a substantial improvement in positive mental health, and psychopathology remains low, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
1,"The individual was largely psychologically healthy at T1 but showed a strong increase in several major risk factors by T2: general psychopathology rose markedly, anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations increased substantially, dysfunctional attitudes increased notably, social support plummeted, and life satisfaction declined—together indicating the development of a psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started at T1 with strong protective factors (low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, high self-efficacy, low anxiety sensitivity and fear), but showed a large increase in general psychopathology and decreased self-efficacy by T2, indicating the onset of significant psychological distress and probable development of a new disorder."
0,"The individual started with high protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, coping, and low dysfunctional attitudes and psychopathology) and experienced further improvements or stable levels in most areas (increases in life satisfaction and positive mental health, further reductions in anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI). The notable decline in self-efficacy is offset by robust protective factors and overall improvement, making the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2 unlikely."
0,"Despite high stress, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations at T1—indicating a risk profile—there is a strong socioeconomic protective factor, no substantial rise in risk factors, and a significant decrease in general psychopathology from T1 to T2, suggesting the individual did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person began with several protective factors at T1 (very low psychopathology, high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and especially low dysfunctional attitudes) and although their positive mental health dropped slightly and general psychopathology increased somewhat by T2, core risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) remained low or decreased, while protective factors (life satisfaction, self-efficacy) improved; there is no strong pattern indicating new disorder development."
0,"The person started with strong protective factors (high social support, positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and low general psychopathology. Despite an increase in some risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and psychopathology), positive mental health and self-efficacy markedly improved, and there is no clear evidence of new disorder development."
0,"Despite substantial decreases in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy) and a notable increase in general psychopathology, the person already had multiple risk factors and dysfunctional attitudes at T1, indicating they were not healthy but had subthreshold or ongoing vulnerability; thus, these changes likely reflect worsening of an existing or ongoing issue rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual began with strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low psychopathology, and risk scores far below average), and although there was a notable drop in life satisfaction and some increase in psychopathology at T2, risk factors remain well below average and protective factors are still present, making the development of a new disorder unlikely."
1,"The individual started with high stress, slightly above average psychopathology, low self-efficacy, and below-average life satisfaction at T1, and then experienced a dramatic increase in general psychopathology (GSI) at T2 (large positive change), along with increased dysfunctional attitudes. This pattern, especially the marked rise in GSI and worsening cognitive risk factors, strongly suggests the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite the below-average education (risk factor) and severely elevated risk factors at T1 (very high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), the individual already showed some psychopathology at baseline and did not appear psychologically healthy at T1. From T1 to T2, there are substantial improvements in major risk factors (large decreases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), so development of a new psychological disorder is unlikely; if anything, the picture suggests symptom reduction rather than new onset."
0,"Despite a substantial decline in positive mental health, the individual started at T1 with low stress and low general psychopathology, and while there are risk factors (high fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and anxiety sensitivity), most risk variables decreased or remained stable over time, with only a mild increase in general psychopathology. There is no compelling evidence of a new psychological disorder developing between T1 and T2."
0,"The person started with strong protective factors at T1 (very high positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support, and low psychopathology), and despite a considerable decrease in positive mental health at T2, there were no substantial increases in risk factors or psychopathological symptoms; general psychopathology even decreased further, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Although the person had multiple risk factors at T1 (very high stress, psychopathology, fear of bodily sensations, anxiety sensitivity, extremely low life satisfaction, low social support, and low socioeconomic status), these symptoms and risk factors substantially improved by T2 (large decreases in GSI, anxiety sensitivity, fear, and dysfunctional attitudes, and significant increases in protective factors such as social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction). This indicates recovery or marked improvement rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite increases in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, the person started with generally good psychological health, maintained high positive mental health, and did not show increases in general psychopathology (GSI) or social support deficits, making new onset of a psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"The individual showed moderate risk due to low positive mental health and high fear of bodily sensations at T1, but protective factors are strong (high education, social support, self-efficacy, low stress, low GSI). From T1 to T2, improvements are seen in positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction, and lower general psychopathology, with no substantial emergence of risk factors, making the development of a new disorder unlikely."
0,"Despite a marked decrease in protective factors (notably self-efficacy and life satisfaction) and a moderate increase in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI), the individual began at T1 with very low psychopathology and strong protective psychological resources, making the pattern more indicative of psychological worsening rather than the development of a new clinical disorder."
0,"Although there is a notable increase in general psychopathology and a large decrease in life satisfaction and self-efficacy from T1 to T2, the person started at T1 with already high risk (very low positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, as well as a negative GSI—in fact, significant psychological difficulties were already present at T1), indicating ongoing distress rather than the development of a new disorder between the two time points."
0,"Despite a high-risk psychological profile at T1 (above-average psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and low self-efficacy), there is no evidence that the individual was healthy at baseline; thus, any deterioration is not the onset of a new disorder but likely a continuation or worsening of existing symptoms."
0,"The individual started with low positive mental health and life satisfaction, but demonstrated strong protective factors: high social support and self-efficacy, low stress, and low overall psychopathology at T1. Over time, there were significant positive changes, with large increases in self-efficacy and life satisfaction and decreases in anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, while general psychopathology remained low; thus, there is no evidence of new psychological disorder development."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and education (risk factors), at T1 there are strong protective factors (high social support, positive mental health, negative dysfunctional attitudes, high coping), though with notable risk from very high stress and some distress. From T1 to T2, loss of social support and self-efficacy, drop in life satisfaction, and increases in anxiety-related risks are concerning, but the substantial reduction in overall psychopathology (GSI), stable negative dysfunctional attitudes, and positive trajectory in positive mental health suggest that no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite some decreases in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy), this individual already had substantial psychological distress at T1 (elevated GSI, dysfunctional attitudes) and did not develop new symptoms; in fact, general psychopathology slightly decreased, indicating ongoing rather than new disorder."
1,"Although the person started with strong protective factors (high positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support), by T2 there were dramatic increases in risk factors—most notably a sharp decline in social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and a marked rise in general psychopathology—indicating the likely onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite demographic risk factors (low education and SES) and slight increases in certain risk variables (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), the individual starts without a psychological disorder at T1, shows significant increases in protective factors (social support, life satisfaction, positive mental health), and experiences only minor increases in general psychopathology, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed by T2."
0,"The individual already displayed multiple risk factors for psychological disorders at T1 (very high anxiety sensitivity, low social support, low positive mental health, low socioeconomic status, and elevated dysfunctional attitudes), and they had slightly elevated psychological distress (GSI) at baseline, suggesting the possibility of an ongoing disorder. While some risk factors remained or mildly increased (GSI and fear of bodily sensations), key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) actually decreased, and important protective factors (positive mental health, social support) improved, making new disorder onset between T1 and T2 unlikely."
0,"Although the person has elevated risk factors at T1 (notably high stress, above-average psychopathology, low positive mental health, negative socioeconomic status, and elevated dysfunctional attitudes), their mental health improves at T2: positive mental health and social support increase, and general psychopathology (GSI) decreases substantially—indicating reduced overall distress and thus suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status (a risk factor), the person had strong protective factors at T1—high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with low psychopathology and negative risk factors. While there were declines in protective factors and an increase in GSI at T2, the changes do not indicate a high enough magnitude or direction of risk to confidently predict development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite extremely poor mental health and high psychopathology at T1 (already well above clinical threshold), all risk factors (GSI, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, fear) substantially decreased by T2 and protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) increased; there is no indication of the new onset of a disorder, but rather probable recovery or improvement."
0,"The individual begins with average or below-average risk levels (low psychopathology, high social support, low dysfunctional attitudes) and shows only small increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, GSI) and decreases in some protective factors, but not of sufficient magnitude or pattern to indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual demonstrated already severe psychopathology (very high GSI) and substantial stress at T1, with low life satisfaction, so any disorder present likely existed at baseline. From T1 to T2, key measures improved: GSI showed a dramatic decrease, life satisfaction increased, and positive mental health improved, suggesting ongoing recovery or stabilization rather than the new onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual already showed clear signs of a psychological disorder at T1 (high GSI, low life satisfaction, low social support, high dysfunctional attitudes), and while some risk factors worsened by T2 (notably a large increase in GSI), there is no evidence of transition from health to disorder, but rather of ongoing or escalating distress from an initial disordered state."
0,"Despite very high stress, anxiety sensitivity, and psychopathology at T1 (indicating a likely ongoing disorder rather than new onset), the person starts with low socioeconomic status and self-efficacy, but protective factors (positive mental health, social support, GSI) markedly improve by T2, while general psychopathology actually decreases; thus, there is no indication of new disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite multiple risk factors at T1—low socioeconomic status, very low self-efficacy, elevated stress, high anxiety sensitivity, and substantial psychological distress—there is no indication of new disorder development because these risk factors and symptoms were already present at T1. In fact, psychopathology (GSI) and several risk factors decrease considerably by T2, suggesting either recovery or no new onset, not the emergence of a new disorder."
0,"Despite some baseline vulnerabilities (e.g., low positive mental health and life satisfaction, slightly elevated psychopathology at T1), the person shows protective factors such as high social support and problem-focused coping, and over time, risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and GSI decreased, while self-efficacy improved, indicating no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person had low positive mental health, low life satisfaction, and strongly limited coping at T1, but also very low psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and fear, with average to mildly protective social factors. While T2 shows a sharp drop in social support and self-efficacy and an increase in risk factors, dysfunctional attitudes actually decrease, and the GSI remains only mildly elevated; there is no clear pattern of new disorder onset but rather a possible worsening of an already at-risk profile."
0,"The individual began with exceptionally strong protective factors at T1, including very high positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress, and very low dysfunctional attitudes and psychopathology. Although there is some decline in these protective factors and a moderate increase in general psychopathology and fear of bodily sensations between T1 and T2, the starting values were so favorable and the changes not extreme enough to suggest the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Despite a relatively healthy psychological baseline at T1 (low general psychopathology, positive life satisfaction, low anxiety/fear), T2 shows significant declines in protective factors (strong decreases in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and especially life satisfaction) and a substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI), suggesting the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started with robust protective factors (high social support, positive mental health, low psychopathology), but experienced large decreases in positive mental health and social support, a marked increase in general psychopathology, and moderate increases in dysfunctional attitudes between T1 and T2, suggesting the likely development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress, low psychopathology) and, while general psychopathology increased slightly by T2, nearly all risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) actually decreased and positive mental health, life satisfaction, and coping remained high or improved, making the development of a psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"Although the individual started with notable risk factors at T1 (low social support and positive mental health, elevated anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes), protective factors and the general psychopathology index (GSI) do not indicate a new onset of disorder by T2. The significant decreases in dysfunctional attitudes and stable to improved markers (dramatically increased social support, self-efficacy, and only slight GSI change) suggest resilience and adaptation rather than the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some initial risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with elevated anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), this person experienced improvements in key protective factors (notably increases in social support, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy, along with a sharp decrease in fear of bodily sensations and stable/lowered general psychopathology). These positive developments suggest no new onset of psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite notable increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, this individual had strong protective factors at baseline (high education, socioeconomic status, life satisfaction, low stress), and general psychopathology (GSI) slightly decreased from T1 to T2, indicating no substantial evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual exhibited high stress and low protective factors at T1, their psychological risk markers (GSI, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) all decreased by T2, showing improvement rather than the emergence of a new disorder."
0,"Although the individual started at T1 with high risk factors (very low self-efficacy and social support, high dysfunctional attitudes, elevated general psychopathology), there are marked improvements from T1 to T2—a substantial reduction in general psychopathology, increases in positive mental health, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy—indicating recovery or improvement rather than the onset of a new disorder."
0,"The individual already showed signs of elevated stress and psychopathology at T1 (high GSI and stress scores), but most risk and protective factors improved or remained stable by T2, with decreases in general psychopathology and fear of bodily sensations, and increases in social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction. Thus, there is no evidence of the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"Despite very strong protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support, and low stress), there is a dramatic worsening in key risk factors between T1 and T2: major increases in anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology (GSI), along with significant drops in self-efficacy and life satisfaction, suggesting onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a low socioeconomic status and notable declines in self-efficacy and life satisfaction from T1 to T2, the individual began with strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, coping, and low psychopathology), and the increase in general psychopathology is moderate, not reaching high levels; there is insufficient evidence of new psychological disorder onset."
0,"The person starts with strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and low dysfunctional attitudes) and low risk factors, and although socioeconomic status is low, there is no meaningful increase in risk indicators from T1 to T2; in fact, some risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, GSI) decrease, making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"Although the individual started with multiple risk factors and high psychopathology at T1, there is strong evidence of recovery by T2: general psychopathology decreases substantially, and risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations drop. There is no indication that a new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2; instead, the pattern reflects improvement or recovery."
0,"Although there are clear risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, high dysfunctional attitudes) and some increases in risk factors (notably anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), protective factors (especially self-efficacy and social support) also sharply increased from T1 to T2, and the overall GSI, while rising, does not strongly suggest the development of a new psychological disorder given the lack of pronounced distress at baseline and substantial improvement in key protective areas."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1—high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and coping—with low risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and low psychopathology. Despite low socioeconomic status and a slight decline in positive mental health, most risk factors decreased further from T1 to T2, and GSI (overall distress) dropped substantially, so development of a new psychological disorder is unlikely."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status (a risk factor), the person was psychologically healthy at T1 with high protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low distress, strong coping, and very low risk factor levels). While there is some increase in dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and GSI by T2, overall levels remain moderate and core protective factors remain intact or improve, suggesting no new disorder development."
0,"The individual possessed strong protective factors at T1, including above-average education, socioeconomic status, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with low stress and psychopathology. Despite some initial risk factors (higher anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, lower positive mental health and coping), their risk profile improved from T1 to T2, evidenced by decreased anxiety sensitivity, increased life satisfaction, stable or reduced GSI, and no significant increase in dysfunction, suggesting no new disorder developed."
0,"Although the individual had very high stress, anxiety sensitivity, and some dysfunctional attitudes at T1 (risk factors), their overall general psychopathology score was average. At T2, while protective factors like social support and life satisfaction decreased and general psychopathology rose modestly, anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes—crucial risk factors—declined, suggesting no new disorder developed but rather a shift or maintenance of already present difficulties."
0,"The individual had several risk factors at T1, such as low education, low positive mental health, low social support, and slightly elevated stress, but also showed low general psychopathology and strongly negative dysfunctional attitudes (protective against depression). Despite a moderate increase in general psychopathology at T2, improvements in positive mental health and social support, along with no significant increases in key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity and fear), suggest no clear evidence of new psychological disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status, education, and BMI (demographic risk factors), the individual started T1 with very low general psychopathology and high protective factors such as social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction. Although general psychopathology increased substantially at T2, there are no large deteriorations in protective factors or key risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes), and the person already had slightly elevated anxiety sensitivity at T1 without apparent disorder. Thus, this pattern suggests distress or symptom increase but not clear development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and a marked decline in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy), the individual began at T1 with elevated general psychopathology but no clear evidence of a new disorder emerging, given the reduction in GSI scores and stability (or moderate worsening) in risk factors, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low education (risk factor) and very high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes at T1 (significant risk factors), this individual already exhibited mild psychopathology at baseline (GSI > 0), and there is no significant increase in GSI over time—in fact, GSI decreased. Thus, there is no evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite a below-average positive mental health at baseline, this individual had low general psychopathology, high social support, low stress, and multiple protective factors at T1. From T1 to T2, key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) decreased, and several protective factors improved (e.g., life satisfaction, self-efficacy); the small increase in psychopathology is not sufficient to indicate development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low psychopathology, and very low risk levels on anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes). Although there was a modest increase in dysfunctional attitudes and psychopathology, positive mental health and self-efficacy further increased, and no marked elevation in risk factors occurred—thus, it is unlikely that the person developed a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and a decrease in social support and positive mental health, the person started with high social support, low stress, low anxiety sensitivity, and very low GSI (psychological distress), and improvements in self-efficacy and stable or improved life satisfaction suggest resilience; the pattern does not support clear onset of a psychological disorder."
1,"Despite strong protective factors at T1 (very high positive mental health and low stress), this person began with significant risk factors (high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, plus low self-efficacy and social support). The subsequent large drop in positive mental health, coupled with increased general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and fear, suggests a shift from resilience to significant psychological risk, indicating the development of a psychological disorder by T2."
0,"Although there is a sharp decline in positive mental health and a notable increase in social support and life satisfaction, risk factors such as general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations all decrease, with no significant elevation in overall psychological distress; the person's robust initial protective factors and reduced risk at T2 do not suggest new disorder development."
0,"The individual started with relatively poor mental health at T1 but low risk for psychopathology (very low GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations). While general psychopathology increased moderately and social support decreased, positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction improved, and most risk factors remained below average, suggesting no clear evidence of new disorder onset."
0,"Although some risk factors increased (notably anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI), the person began with very high protective factors (self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support) and extremely low baseline risk (GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity). Despite a marked drop in life satisfaction and self-efficacy, the overall changes do not reach a magnitude or pattern indicative of the onset of a new psychological disorder, as most variables remain within healthy or only slightly elevated ranges."
0,"Despite some baseline risk factors such as low positive mental health and life satisfaction, moderate anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, there are no major increases in general psychopathology or other risk factors between T1 and T2; some risk factors even decrease substantially (notably fear of bodily sensations). The lack of strong increase in distress and only mild changes overall suggest this person did not develop a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started with multiple risk factors at T1—low education, very low positive mental health, very low social support, low self-efficacy, high stress, and extremely low coping—with a notable drop in social support and life satisfaction from T1 to T2, along with a considerable increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology (GSI), all indicating the development of a psychological disorder at T2."
0,"Although there are declines in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction from T1 to T2, the person started with strong protective factors (very high life satisfaction and social support, low stress, low risk factors) and general psychopathology actually decreases at T2, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had generally favorable T1 mental health (low stress, high social support, positive mental health and life satisfaction, and low psychopathology), and despite initial risk factors (high fear of bodily sensations and anxiety sensitivity), both risk factors improved substantially by T2; protective factors like life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and social support all increased, and only a minimal rise in overall psychopathology was observed—insufficient to suggest new disorder development."
0,"Despite increases in several risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI), the individual started at T1 with below-average risk (low psychopathology, very low anxiety and fear, low dysfunctional attitudes) and demonstrated increases in protective factors (notably large improvements in life satisfaction and self-efficacy); the overall pattern does not indicate an unequivocal shift from healthy to a clear disorder at T2."
0,"The individual already exhibited low psychological distress and strong protective factors at T1, and although general self-efficacy decreased and general psychopathology increased somewhat, positive mental health and life satisfaction increased markedly at T2; overall, the pattern suggests improvement rather than the onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a notable increase in general psychopathology (GSI) between T1 and T2, the individual started from a psychologically healthy baseline with strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, coping skills, low dysfunctional attitudes, low psychopathology) and no baseline disorders. There is no clear pattern of deteriorating risk factors large enough to suggest the development of a new psychological disorder, especially as several protective factors and risk factors (e.g., dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity) actually improved or remained stable."
0,"Despite some low baseline protective factors (mental health, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, coping), this individual exhibited low risk factors at T1 (anxiety sensitivity, fear, psychopathology), had no increase in overall psychological distress from T1 to T2, and no substantial rise in central risk domains; therefore, there is no evidence of development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual was psychologically healthy at T1 with below-average risk factors and strong protective factors (low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, high life satisfaction), but experienced a strong increase in dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and a marked rise in general psychopathology at T2, supporting the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had protective factors at T1 (high social support, low stress, good self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low psychopathology) and, although positive mental health decreased and anxiety sensitivity increased slightly, there was a marked improvement in life satisfaction and a clear decrease in general psychopathology by T2, indicating that a new psychological disorder did not develop."
0,"The individual started with some risk factors (low socioeconomic status and low positive mental health), but demonstrated strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, high social support, low dysfunctional attitudes). Importantly, from T1 to T2, all key psychological measures improved or remained stable: positive mental health and life satisfaction increased substantially, general psychopathology decreased markedly, and no substantial increases in risk factors are apparent—indicating no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite a sharp decline in positive mental health, the individual starts with strong protective factors at T1, including high positive mental health, self-efficacy, low anxiety sensitivity, low dysfunctional attitudes, and very low general psychopathology. T2 shows increased social support, decreased general psychopathology, and decreases in risk factors such as dysfunctional attitudes and fear of bodily sensations, all suggesting resilience and no evidence of new disorder development."
0,"The individual showed some baseline risk factors at T1, such as below-average self-efficacy, low coping, and mildly elevated anxiety sensitivity and GSI, but overall had protective factors such as good social support, life satisfaction, and low dysfunctional attitudes. Between T1 and T2, risk factors generally improved (notably large decreases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and GSI), and while self-efficacy and positive mental health declined, there is no strong evidence of a new psychological disorder developing given the marked reduction in general psychopathology and several risk variables."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status (a risk factor), the individual showed improved positive mental health and stable or low psychopathology at T2; while anxiety sensitivity increased, overall general psychopathology actually decreased and their initial mental state was relatively healthy, indicating they did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes increased between T1 and T2, the person already had elevated psychopathology at T1 (GSI = 1.25), suggesting the presence of a psychological disorder at baseline rather than a new onset. Moreover, the decrease in general psychopathology at T2 (GSI change = -1.71) further indicates improvement rather than new disorder development."
0,"The individual starts with average-to-low risk due to high socioeconomic status, low baseline stress, low anxiety sensitivity, and low general psychopathology, despite low positive mental health and self-efficacy and elevated dysfunctional attitudes. Key protective factors (positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy) substantially improve between T1 and T2, and no significant increase in general psychopathology occurs, so there is no evidence for new disorder development."
0,"Although the individual had several risk factors at T1 (high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and psychopathology), their mental health actually improved between T1 and T2, as indicated by substantial decreases in general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes, despite declines in positive mental health and life satisfaction. There is no evidence of a new disorder developing; rather, there is improvement in most core risk variables."
0,"Despite a large decrease in positive mental health and self-efficacy, this individual had low psychopathology at T1, increases in social support and life satisfaction, and declines in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes; the slight rise in general psychopathology does not reach a level suggestive of new disorder onset."
0,"Although life satisfaction and positive mental health decreased somewhat, the person started with very high protective factors (extremely high life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low psychological distress), most protective factors remained stable or improved (increased self-efficacy, low and decreased dysfunctional attitudes, stable low psychopathology), and risk factors remained low; thus, there is no evidence of new disorder development."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; low stress; high problem-focused coping), and despite a notable drop in positive mental health by T2, there were simultaneous increases in life satisfaction and a reduction in general psychopathology, suggesting recovery or stability rather than the onset of a new disorder."
0,"Although there is a notable increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, protective factors (such as a sharp decline in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes) suggest significant positive psychological changes; furthermore, the individual already exhibited substantial risk at T1 (high dysfunctional attitudes, low self-efficacy, low social support), likely indicating ongoing or pre-existing vulnerability rather than new disorder onset."
0,"The person displayed severe psychological distress and several risk factors at T1 (high GSI, high dysfunctional attitudes, low life satisfaction, very low self-efficacy), indicating a likely existing disorder rather than developing a new one at T2. By T2, all risk markers (GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, stress, etc.) improved significantly, with large increases in protective factors such as self-efficacy and life satisfaction, making it very unlikely that a new disorder developed in the interval."
0,"Despite low education and socioeconomic status (risk factors), the individual started with overall low psychopathology, high social support, and low dysfunctional attitudes at T1, with notable improvements in self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and further reductions in dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity by T2. Although there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology, the strong protective changes and absence of significant baseline risk suggest no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite low education and high initial stress, the individual showed very strong protective baseline factors (exceptional general self-efficacy, high social support, low dysfunctional attitudes, low anxiety sensitivity, and below-average psychopathology at T1), and all risk markers either improved or remained stable between T1 and T2—most importantly, positive mental health increased substantially and general psychopathology decreased—making the development of a new psychological disorder highly unlikely."
1,"Despite a very healthy and resilient psychological profile at T1—marked by exceptionally high positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, and low general psychopathology—there are dramatic deteriorations across multiple protective factors at T2 (notably large drops in positive mental health and self-efficacy, a significant increase in dysfunctional attitudes, and a marked rise in general psychopathology), supporting the development of a new psychological disorder by T2."
0,"Although this individual experienced a sharp decline in positive mental health and increases in some risk factors (fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes), their baseline at T1 included already high general psychopathology (GSI) and anxiety sensitivity, indicating an ongoing psychological disorder rather than new onset. The GSI actually decreased over time, and there is no evidence of a new disorder developing between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status as a risk factor, the individual had strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, low psychopathology, and negative dysfunctional attitudes), and while there were modest increases in general psychopathology at T2 and some reductions in positive mental health/life satisfaction, these changes are not substantial or pervasive enough to suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual has low socioeconomic status (risk) and a significant decrease in life satisfaction at T2, most protective factors (low dysfunctional attitudes, increased social support, improved self-efficacy) and decreased risk factors (lower GSI, reduced anxiety sensitivity) indicate improved mental health and no evidence of new disorder development."
0,"The person showed some initial risk factors at T1—low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, moderate dysfunctional attitudes, and above-average anxiety sensitivity/fear of bodily sensations—but protective factors such as moderate social support, low stress, and average life satisfaction. Importantly, most risk factors decreased over time (notably anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), positive mental health improved, general psychopathology did not increase, and there were no strong negative trends, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although general psychopathology (GSI) increased substantially and protective factors (such as self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and positive mental health) decreased, the individual already had elevated stress and GSI, as well as some risk factors (low SES, dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations) at T1, suggesting the presence of a pre-existing psychological disorder or significant distress; thus, this does not represent the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person started with some elevated risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, elevated anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations) but had no clinical levels of psychopathology; from T1 to T2, most risk factors decreased and protective factors increased, while there was no meaningful increase in general psychopathology—therefore, there is no evidence of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the person had considerable psychological vulnerabilities at T1 (very high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, general psychopathology, and low self-efficacy), these risk factors markedly decreased by T2 (notably large declines in anxiety and psychopathology scores, with improved self-efficacy), indicating increased psychological health and no new disorder development."
0,"Despite initial low general self-efficacy and high dysfunctional attitudes at T1, the person’s risk factors generally decreased or stayed stable at T2 (notably, anxiety sensitivity dropped markedly, and general psychopathology decreased). High education and socioeconomic status were protective, and there is no evidence of a clinically significant increase in psychological problems between T1 and T2."
1,"Although the individual started with above-average protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction) and low baseline psychopathology, the substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI), strong increase in fear of bodily sensations, decrease in self-efficacy and positive mental health, and increased anxiety sensitivity indicate the likely development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person started with good mental health, low stress, slightly above-average coping skills, and low psychopathology at T1. Although there are some increases in anxiety sensitivity and a decrease in life satisfaction at T2, protective factors such as increased self-efficacy, a reduction in dysfunctional attitudes, and relatively stable general psychopathology make it unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The person started with low positive mental health and social support, but demonstrated a significant increase in positive mental health and social support by T2, while key risk factors, such as general psychopathology, remained low or decreased. There is no evidence of new risk elevation or significant rise in psychopathology, suggesting no development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some demographic risks (lower education and socioeconomic status) and a few elevated risk factors at T1 (notably dysfunctional attitudes and below-average self-efficacy), the individual showed substantial positive changes between T1 and T2—most notably large increases in general self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction, along with strong reductions in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology—making it unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The person already showed significantly elevated general psychopathology (GSI) at T1, coupled with low self-efficacy and below-average social support, suggesting they likely had an ongoing psychological disorder; by T2, several risk factors (GSI, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) actually decreased, and there was no evidence of new disorder onset."
1,"The person began with low positive mental health and general self-efficacy, as well as high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations—substantial risk factors—though their general psychopathology was below average. From T1 to T2, key risk indicators (life satisfaction, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI) worsened considerably, especially with a marked increase in global psychological distress, which strongly supports the development of a psychological disorder."
1,"The person started with some risk factors at T1 (lower positive mental health, low self-efficacy, high stress) but had very low dysfunctional attitudes and low psychopathology. However, from T1 to T2, there was a marked increase in general psychopathology (GSI), a loss of social support, and decreased life satisfaction—indicating a new onset of significant psychological distress and probable disorder."
0,"The individual already exhibited substantial risk factors and clinical levels of psychopathology at T1 (elevated GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations), so while some symptoms improved by T2, there is no evidence of a new disorder developing between T1 and T2—rather, existing distress likely persisted or diminished."
1,"Although the person had low positive mental health at T1, they were otherwise psychologically healthy with strong social support and low general psychopathology. By T2, there was a sharp loss in social support and substantial increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and overall psychological distress—together indicating development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite sharp increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, improvements in social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, along with stable general psychopathology and a marked reduction in dysfunctional attitudes, indicate that the person did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person started with slightly above-average social support and coping abilities, low dysfunctional attitudes, and mild psychological distress, while substantially increasing protective factors between T1 and T2 (notably, strong improvements in life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and decreased general psychopathology). These changes indicate recovery or stable mental health, not the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with relatively low positive mental health and very low life satisfaction (risk factors), but exhibited protective factors such as average to high social support, below-average stress, and low psychopathology at T1. At T2, key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, general psychopathology) all decreased notably and life satisfaction improved substantially, suggesting that rather than developing a new disorder, the individual's overall psychological well-being improved."
0,"Despite initial demographic risk factors and poor mental health at T1, this individual experienced large improvements in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) between T1 and T2, and while general psychopathology increased, the strong enhancements in multiple protective domains make it unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The individual began with strong protective factors (high social support, life satisfaction, positive mental health, low stress, high SES) and, though positive mental health dropped sharply at T2, risk factors like anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology all decreased. There is no indication of new disorder development, as overall psychological health remains protected and general psychopathology improved."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and very low life satisfaction at T1, the individual already exhibited significant psychological distress (high GSI), indicating an ongoing disorder at baseline. Substantial improvements in life satisfaction, positive mental health, social support, reduced dysfunctional attitudes, and a marked decrease in general psychopathology from T1 to T2 all strongly suggest recovery rather than new disorder onset."
1,"The individual was psychologically healthy at T1 with strong protective factors (very high positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction, and low general psychopathology), but between T1 and T2, experienced severe declines in key protective factors (large drops in self-efficacy and life satisfaction), sharp increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations), and an uptick in general psychopathology, indicating onset of a psychological disorder at T2."
0,"The person already exhibited significant psychopathology at T1 (high GSI), along with elevated risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and moderate stress, despite some protective factors (high life satisfaction, good social support). While some risk factors increased from T1 to T2 (e.g., GSI, dysfunctional attitudes), this pattern reflects the ongoing or worsening of an existing issue rather than the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"This person started at T1 with exceptionally strong protective factors—high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress, high coping abilities, and very low risk indicators (low GSI, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes). While there were some increases in risk factors (notably anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and GSI) and reductions in protective factors from T1 to T2, the initial baseline was highly resilient with no evidence of prior disorder, and the changes do not reach a magnitude or pattern suggesting the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person already exhibited significant psychological distress at T1 (high GSI, stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and low self-efficacy), indicating an existing disorder rather than new onset. From T1 to T2, key risk factors and overall psychopathology decreased, with no evidence suggesting the development of a new disorder."
1,"The individual started with low risk at T1 (very low general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations), but experienced significant declines in life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy, and positive mental health, as well as a substantial increase in general psychopathology from T1 to T2—together indicating the likely onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite declines in some protective factors (positive mental health and social support), the individual’s baseline risk was extremely low, and there were substantial continued protective factors (very high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, coping, and support) coupled with reductions in dysfunctional attitudes and overall psychopathology; the pattern does not support the onset of a new psychological disorder."
1,"This individual started with high positive mental health and social support, but experienced a very large drop in positive mental health and a substantial rise in general psychopathology (GSI), anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes from T1 to T2. The combination of these shifts toward increased risk factors, particularly the high rise in overall psychological distress, strongly suggests the development of a psychological disorder at T2."
0,"Despite a large drop in positive mental health and a slight increase in anxiety sensitivity, the strong increases in social support and life satisfaction, as well as a significant decrease in dysfunctional attitudes, are robust protective factors that suggest the individual did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there is a strong decline in protective factors such as positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy from T1 to T2, initial T1 psychopathology (GSI) was above average, so the individual was not healthy at baseline; in fact, general psychopathology decreases over time. This pattern indicates no new disorder developed between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual had multiple risk factors at T1, including low positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction. Between T1 and T2, further decreases in protective factors (e.g., positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy) occurred alongside strong increases in risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and GSI), indicating likely onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with high general self-efficacy and strong coping skills, despite moderate risk factors (e.g., elevated dysfunctional attitudes, minor psychopathology, low positive mental health). Over time, there is a noted reduction in protective factors (lower self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support) but no significant increases in risk factors or overall psychopathology, which even decreases; thus, there is no evidence supporting the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low baseline social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, and an increase in dysfunctional attitudes, there is no significant increase in overall psychological distress (GSI) between T1 and T2; the individual had mild distress at T1 and no clear worsening, suggesting no new psychological disorder was developed."
0,"The person was already exhibiting a profile strongly indicative of psychological distress and possible disorder at T1—very low positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy, plus high stress and dysfunctional attitudes—suggesting they were not psychologically healthy to begin with. The substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI) likely reflects a worsening or continuation of pre-existing problems rather than the development of a new disorder from a healthy baseline."
0,"Despite high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology at T1 (indicating a likely existing disorder), there are significant reductions in global severity, life satisfaction, and anxiety sensitivity at T2, suggesting improvement or recovery rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there is a marked increase in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes from T1 to T2 (risk factors), the individual starts from a position of low psychopathology, high life satisfaction, and very low stress at T1, with only a negligible increase in general psychopathology at T2—indicating no substantial new psychological disorder has developed, despite elevated risk markers."
0,"The individual started with generally good mental health, low risk factors, and strong protective factors at T1, and experienced significant improvements in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and further reductions in risk factors between T1 and T2; there is no pattern suggesting the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite significant decreases in positive mental health and increases in some risk factors, the person experienced notable increases in protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction), maintained low or decreasing psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, and even saw a large drop in general psychological distress, indicating a lowered risk of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual exhibited high psychological risk at T1 (notably high GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and low self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction), all key risk factors markedly decreased and protective factors improved between T1 and T2, suggesting recovery or ongoing disorder rather than the onset of a new disorder."
0,"Although the individual started with several risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; high dysfunctional attitudes), all protective factors improved between T1 and T2 (higher positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support; lower dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity), while the increase in general psychopathology (GSI) was mild and likely remained subclinical. The combination of significant positive change across key domains and high socioeconomic status make it unlikely they developed a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some increases in risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, GSI, and a significant drop in life satisfaction), the individual had relatively low risk at T1 (low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, strong life satisfaction, average social support), and changes, while present, remain moderate and do not indicate a shift from a clearly healthy psychological profile to one likely characterized by a new disorder at T2."
0,"Despite some decreases in positive mental health and life satisfaction, the individual started with good protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and low stress) and exhibited substantial decreases in risk factors (notably, a marked drop in fear of bodily sensations and anxiety sensitivity). There are no significant elevations in general psychopathology or dysfunctional attitudes, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although this individual started with below-average mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, they experienced strong improvements by T2 in social support, self-efficacy, positive mental health, and reductions in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes. Despite a small increase in general psychopathology, the substantial boosts in protective factors suggest they did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and low coping at T1 (risk factors), the individual started with high positive mental health and self-efficacy, and from T1 to T2 showed improvements in almost all protective factors and a reduction in general psychopathology. There is no evidence of new onset psychopathology—rather, their mental health appears to have improved."
0,"The individual began with several risk factors (low positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction), but between T1 and T2 key protective factors improved (notably positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction), while risk factors like anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology either decreased or remained low. Despite a drop in self-efficacy, the overall pattern suggests psychological functioning improved or remained stable, making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"The individual began at T1 with exceptionally strong protective factors including very high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, low general psychopathology, low anxiety sensitivity, few dysfunctional attitudes, and high problem-focused coping. Although there was a decrease in some protective variables (social support, life satisfaction) and minor increases in a few risk factors, none of these changes were of sufficient magnitude or direction to suggest the development of a new psychological disorder by T2."
1,"The individual began with several risk factors at T1, including low positive mental health, low social support and self-efficacy, high dysfunctional attitudes, and although initial general psychopathology was low, there were dramatic increases from T1 to T2 in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and especially general psychopathology (GSI), strongly suggesting the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual started with below-average protective factors and some elevated risk (low mental health, life satisfaction, support, self-efficacy, and somewhat raised dysfunctional attitudes), between T1 and T2 they showed strong improvements in protective factors (substantial increases in life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy, and positive mental health) and only marginal increases in risk, with general psychopathology remaining low. This pattern suggests recovery and resilience, not the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person had a strong protective profile at T1 (high positive mental health, life satisfaction, problem-focused coping, low dysfunctional attitudes), and while life satisfaction and positive mental health decreased at T2, other protective factors (social support, self-efficacy) increased and both general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes decreased, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status, education, and BMI (risk factors), this individual already had significant psychopathology at T1 (very high GSI, high stress, extremely low social support, low life satisfaction), so they were not healthy at baseline. Although some risk and protective factors changed (notably, much improved GSI, social support, and positive mental health at T2), there is no evidence of developing a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there is an increase in risk factors (notably rising general psychopathology, reduced self-efficacy and positive mental health, and some increases in anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes), the person started from a very psychologically healthy baseline (low psychopathology, high self-efficacy, strong social support, above average life satisfaction, low dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity), and even with some declines, life satisfaction rises considerably and no variable reaches a magnitude suggesting the onset of a new disorder."
0,"Although the person started with several risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low social support, low self-efficacy, and low life satisfaction), they showed strong improvements in protective factors (notably large increases in life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy, and positive mental health) and reductions in several risk factors from T1 to T2, despite a minor increase in general psychopathology; overall, the profile does not indicate the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite demographic risk from low education and socioeconomic status and high BMI, the individual started with above average self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and low psychopathology. Between T1 and T2, positive mental health and social support increased, and although self-efficacy and life satisfaction decreased, anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes remained low and general psychopathology decreased, indicating no emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person began with some risk factors at T1, such as low positive mental health and mildly above-average general psychopathology, but also possessed numerous strong protective factors (low dysfunctional attitudes, low anxiety sensitivity, low fear of bodily sensations, good self-efficacy). Importantly, despite small increases in some risk factors between T1 and T2, the overall general psychopathology index dropped substantially, and there is no indication of a clinically significant new disorder developing."
0,"Although some risk factors emerged (notably a dramatic drop in protective factors like self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction), the individual's T1 baseline mental health was quite healthy, and despite an increase in dysfunctional attitudes and GSI, the overall psychological distress (GSI) only rose slightly and did not exceed average levels, suggesting a significant psychological decline but no clear evidence of a new psychological disorder emerging."
0,"Despite low positive mental health and high stress at T1, the individual possessed strong protective factors (high social support, good coping skills, low anxiety sensitivity, and low dysfunctional attitudes), and all key risk factors improved between T1 and T2 (notably with large increases in positive mental health, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and a decrease in general psychopathology), indicating no development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although the person experienced a meaningful increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and a decrease in positive mental health from T1 to T2, they also showed substantial increases in key protective factors (social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy) and notable decreases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations). Their profile suggests overall improvement and increased resilience, making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
1,"The individual was psychologically vulnerable at T1—although protective factors like low anxiety sensitivity, low fear of bodily sensations, and low dysfunctional attitudes were present, there was already elevated stress and general psychopathology. From T1 to T2, there are dramatic increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), alongside a severe drop in social support and life satisfaction, strongly indicating the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite high baseline stress, anxiety sensitivity, and extremely elevated dysfunctional attitudes at T1 (all risk factors), there is improvement over time: dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations, and anxiety sensitivity decline, while protective factors like positive mental health and self-efficacy increase. GSI change is minimal, so there is no strong indication of new-onset psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual already exhibited severe psychopathology at T1 (very high GSI, stress, anxiety sensitivity, low protective factors), indicating they likely had an ongoing psychological disorder at baseline; therefore, any continued impairment at T2 does not represent the development of a new disorder."
0,"The person had generally good or above-average protective factors (high social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and low stress) at T1 and demonstrated improvements or stability in these areas at T2, with decreased risk factors (notably lower anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, and no increase in general psychopathology), making the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2 highly unlikely."
0,"Despite substantial baseline risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; high stress; low SES), there are improvements or stability in most protective factors from T1 to T2 (increases in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; stable social support and GSI remains below average), suggesting the person did not develop a new psychological disorder."
1,"The person was psychologically healthy at T1, with above average social support, low stress, low general psychopathology, and low risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes). However, from T1 to T2 there was a large increase in general psychopathology (GSI), decrease in self-efficacy and social support, and rising dysfunctional attitudes, supporting that a new psychological disorder likely developed."
0,"The individual began with very strong protective factors (high life satisfaction, self-efficacy, low dysfunctional attitudes, low psychopathology) despite increased stress. Over time, protective factors such as self-efficacy and social support increased, and general psychopathology decreased; while there was a marked drop in positive mental health and a substantial increase in fear of bodily sensations, the overall risk balance and strong baseline suggest no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Although there were strikingly high risk factors at T1 (especially elevated anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), all major risk factors and distress indicators improved substantially between T1 and T2—most notably, general psychopathology and anxiety sensitivity decreased greatly, and life satisfaction and social support increased—suggesting recovery or significant improvement rather than the development of a new disorder."
1,"The individual had extremely high positive mental health at T1 but suffered a dramatic decline by T2, along with a large drop in self-efficacy and social support and a notable increase in general psychopathology, despite some improvement in life satisfaction and anxiety sensitivity. This strong shift from an unusually positive baseline into notably more risk-laden psychological territory, particularly the severe loss in key protective factors and increased distress, suggest the development of a psychological disorder by T2."
0,"Although the person had low self-efficacy and life satisfaction and moderately high dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology at T1, they experienced substantial increases in self-efficacy and life satisfaction, as well as reductions in dysfunctional attitudes, social support, anxiety sensitivity, and psychopathology by T2. These positive changes indicate that the individual did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and high initial dysfunctional attitudes, substantial improvements in life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and positive mental health were observed from T1 to T2, while general psychopathology actually decreased—suggesting the person did not develop a psychological disorder between time points."
0,"Despite some demographic risk factors (lower education and socioeconomic status), the individual started with a very low-risk psychological profile at T1 (high self-efficacy, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low anxiety sensitivity), and changes from T1 to T2 either reflected slight improvements or only minor increases in risk, with no meaningful increase in psychopathology; there is no evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Despite initially healthy psychological functioning at T1 (high self-efficacy, coping, life satisfaction, and low psychopathology), the sharp declines in life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and social support, along with notable increases in general psychopathology (GSI) and anxiety sensitivity between T1 and T2, point to the new onset of a psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started with multiple risk factors at T1, including low socioeconomic status, extremely low social support, very low life satisfaction, and elevated dysfunctional attitudes. Between T1 and T2, they experienced marked increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, all of which strongly signal the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite significant decreases in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy), the individual started from an extremely resilient baseline with high positive mental health, strong self-efficacy, and very low risk factors—including negative dysfunctional attitudes and low general psychopathology. The overall psychopathology (GSI) did not meaningfully increase, suggesting no new disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite elevated initial risk factors at T1 (high stress, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes), there were substantial increases in protective factors—positive mental health and self-efficacy—in T2, alongside a reduction in general psychopathology. These positive shifts suggest improvement rather than the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual began with low risk (strong protective factors such as high general self-efficacy, low stress, low anxiety sensitivity, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low general psychopathology), and although positive mental health significantly declined and self-efficacy dropped, social support and life satisfaction improved, while general psychopathology remained low and even decreased slightly—indicating no clear emergence of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low education and a slight decline in protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) along with a substantial rise in dysfunctional attitudes, the individual had strong baseline protective factors (very low stress, supportive environment, very low anxiety sensitivity, and very low fear of bodily sensations), maintained low or declining psychopathology (strong drop in GSI), and showed no clear shift to high-risk patterns, making new disorder onset unlikely."
1,"Although the individual started with high positive mental health and low stress, there were multiple risk factors at baseline (low socioeconomic status, low social support, high dysfunctional attitudes, and high anxiety sensitivity). Critically, there was a dramatic drop in positive mental health, life satisfaction, and an increase in general psychopathology (GSI), suggesting the onset of a new psychological disorder at T2."
0,"Despite low education (risk factor) and low positive mental health and self-efficacy at T1 (risk factors), this person already showed elevated psychopathology (GSI) at T1 and did not significantly worsen in core psychopathology or dysfunctional attitudes over time—in fact, GSI decreased substantially and dysfunctional attitudes reduced. There is no evidence of developing a new disorder between T1 and T2; rather, the individual may have experienced some improvement."
0,"Despite low education (a potential risk factor), the individual had high protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction) but also already elevated psychopathology (very high GSI) and anxiety sensitivity. However, the large decrease in GSI and no worsening of key risk factors suggest the person was already disordered at T1 and actually improved by T2, so no new disorder developed."
1,"The person started with some risk due to low socioeconomic status, education, elevated stress, moderate anxiety sensitivity, and below-average life satisfaction, but showed resilience with above-average social support and self-efficacy. Critically, there is a large increase in general psychopathology (GSI), a dramatic drop in life satisfaction, and only small changes in protective factors—suggesting that a new psychological disorder likely developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite the low socioeconomic status (risk factor) and a significant decrease in positive mental health, the individual maintained high life satisfaction, increased coping abilities, decreased dysfunctional attitudes, and only a minimal increase in general psychopathology, suggesting they did not develop a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite declines in protective factors like self-efficacy and life satisfaction, this individual started with exceptionally high protective factors at T1 and low risk factors, and there is no significant increase in psychological distress (GSI) or other core risk variables at T2; thus, there is no strong evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person showed already high general psychopathology at T1 (GSI far above average), indicating an existing psychological disorder, but there is marked improvement between T1 and T2 (sharp reduction in GSI and fear of bodily sensations, large increase in positive mental health), suggesting recovery rather than new onset; thus, no new disorder developed between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual started with somewhat mixed protective and risk factors at T1 (notably high positive mental health but very low coping and social support, some low self-efficacy and life satisfaction). Critically, from T1 to T2, there were substantial increases in key risk factors: large drops in self-efficacy, significant rises in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology (GSI), all indicating pronounced increasing vulnerability and likely onset of a psychological disorder."
1,"The individual showed declines in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy) and substantial increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, general psychopathology). This pattern, especially the marked increase in psychological distress, strongly suggests the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person started T1 with several protective factors (high self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction, low stress, low anxiety sensitivity, and negative dysfunctional attitudes), and from T1 to T2 most risk factors did not increase meaningfully; in fact, positive mental health and life satisfaction improved substantially and general psychopathology decreased. There is no pattern indicating the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although socioeconomic status is low (risk factor) and there is a slight increase in general psychopathology, all key T1 measures indicate a psychologically healthy baseline (low risk, high self-efficacy, low psychopathology, low anxiety/fears), and from T1 to T2, major protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support) increase, while risk factors remain low or show only minor increases; this pattern is inconsistent with the development of a new disorder."
0,"Despite pronounced decreases in positive mental health and life satisfaction and a substantial rise in fear of bodily sensations, the individual already displayed several elevated risk factors (high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, moderate GSI) at T1, indicating pre-existing psychological vulnerability or possible ongoing symptoms; there is no strong evidence here of a new disorder developing between T1 and T2 given the stable or improved general psychopathology and some decreases in other risk factors."
0,"The individual was already experiencing significant psychological distress at T1 (elevated stress and GSI), suggesting an existing disorder rather than new onset. Although several risk factors worsened (notably anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI), this pattern reflects either the persistence or exacerbation of a pre-existing issue, rather than the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual began with high stress, low self-efficacy, below-average life satisfaction, and elevated dysfunctional attitudes, but no significant baseline psychopathology. Marked declines in protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction) combined with a strong increase in the Global Severity Index and dysfunctional attitudes indicate a significant deterioration and high likelihood of developing a psychological disorder at T2."
0,"Despite low education (risk) and high initial anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, T1 psychopathology was only slightly elevated and key protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, problem-focused coping) were strong. From T1 to T2, most risk factors remained stable or improved (notably, general psychopathology and fear of bodily sensations decreased, life satisfaction and social support increased), suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had very high general psychopathology (GSI) at T1, indicating an existing psychological disorder, and while protective factors such as positive mental health and life satisfaction decreased at T2, risk factors like GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, and anxiety sensitivity all substantially decreased, suggesting significant recovery rather than the development of a new disorder."
0,"Despite low education and socioeconomic status (risk factors), this person had healthy baseline scores (very low stress, low anxiety sensitivity, low general psychopathology, strong coping skills, very low dysfunctional attitudes) and experienced improved positive mental health and social support at T2. Although general psychopathology increased somewhat, it did not reflect a substantial emergence of risk factors for disorder onset, and several protective factors remained stable or improved."
0,"The person already exhibited significant psychopathology and risk factors at T1 (high GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, and low social support), but showed marked improvements across nearly all domains by T2. There is no evidence of new disorder development—rather, the profile suggests recovery or significant symptom reduction."
0,"The person started with a healthy baseline at T1, showing strong protective factors (very high life satisfaction, social support, low psychopathology, low anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes). From T1 to T2, there were increases in some risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, mild increase in general psychopathology), but even with these increases, the positive direction in key protective factors (notably large increase in self-efficacy, improvement in positive mental health and life satisfaction) suggest resilience and no clear evidence for the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite demographic risk factors (low BMI and socioeconomic status), the person started with low-to-average mental health but no signs of disorder at T1, and while some risk factors increased (GSI, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes), the magnitude of change is modest and no specific variable crosses into clearly elevated risk, suggesting some deterioration but likely not the development of a new disorder."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 (e.g., lower education, some dysfunctional attitudes, and low coping), the person started with high positive mental health, low stress, and only mild psychological distress. Over time, there were notable increases in protective factors (greater self-efficacy and life satisfaction) and decreases in risk factors (drop in anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), indicating psychological stability or improvement rather than the development of a new disorder."
1,"Despite a strong protective baseline at T1 with high positive mental health, life satisfaction, and low dysfunctional attitudes, there is a marked decline in protective factors (sharp drops in positive mental health and self-efficacy) and a substantial rise in risk factors (large increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology) by T2, suggesting the new development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite high initial stress, anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes at T1, there were strong protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, positive mental health, adaptive coping), and T2 saw decreases in key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes), with no major increases in general psychopathology—suggesting no new disorder development."
1,"While this person started with fairly low baseline risk (low stress, low psychopathology, and reasonable self-efficacy), several protective factors worsened (drop in life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support) and risk factors increased (notably, large rises in general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations). The significant increase in psychopathology alongside these deteriorations strongly indicates the onset of a psychological disorder at T2."
1,"The individual began with strong risk factors at T1, including very low protective demographics (education, BMI, SES), very low positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, and very high dysfunctional attitudes. Despite significant improvements in positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy at T2, there was a dramatic increase in general psychopathology (GSI +2.05), indicating the onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had a very healthy baseline at T1 with high protective factors (social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, problem-focused coping, low stress and GSI) and although there were some increases in risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations, GSI), the overall levels remain within a generally healthy range, with no strong evidence for the onset of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started out with some risk factors (notably low positive mental health and somewhat elevated dysfunctional attitudes), but also demonstrated protective factors (good social support, self-efficacy, and satisfaction, as well as low psychopathology). Over time, protective factors increased (higher positive mental health and life satisfaction), risk factors decreased (lower anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), and overall psychological distress increased only modestly—none of which strongly indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had relatively low psychopathology and anxiety-related risk factors at T1, and although there was a modest increase in anxiety sensitivity and general self-efficacy between T1 and T2, protective factors (social support, life satisfaction, low stress, low dysfunctional attitudes) remained generally positive/stable, and the increase in general psychopathology was minor—together, this does not indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Despite some protective factors at T1, this individual had elevated risk indicators (high stress, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI) and experienced sharp increases in general psychopathology and anxiety-related symptoms between T1 and T2, suggesting the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite the demographic risk factors (lower education, BMI, and socioeconomic status), the individual had high protective factors at T1 (self-efficacy, life satisfaction, problem-solving/ coping, and social support), and over time, most risk indicators either improved or stayed stable, with general psychopathology decreasing, indicating no development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual started with low protective factors (low education, SES, BMI, social support, positive mental health, and life satisfaction) and showed a substantial increase in general psychopathology, fear of bodily sensations, and a marked decrease in self-efficacy between T1 and T2, indicating new onset of psychological distress consistent with developing a psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with several protective factors (high self-efficacy, low stress and psychopathology, higher SES) and, across T1 to T2, showed marked improvements in protective variables (large increases in social support, self-efficacy, positive mental health, and life satisfaction) while risk factors either decreased or remained stable; there is no indication of significant psychopathology development, so a new disorder is unlikely."
0,"Although there is a large increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, the individual started from an exceptionally healthy baseline (very low GSI, low stress, low dysfunctional attitudes) and did not have marked increases in any other key risk factors or sharp declines in protective factors; there is also some improvement in positive mental health and stable or improved scores on relevant variables, making the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2 unlikely."
0,"Despite some initial risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health and self-efficacy, high dysfunctional attitudes, elevated stress), there are substantial improvements by T2, including marked increases in self-efficacy and life satisfaction, large decreases in dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity, and stable or slightly improved general psychopathology. These strong protective changes outweigh the initial risks, indicating no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Although the individual started with multiple risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low social support, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction), their positive mental health and social support both improved substantially by T2, and there were no major increases in risk variables or general psychopathology from T1 to T2. This suggests that, despite ongoing vulnerabilities, they did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual had relatively healthy baseline mental health at T1 (low GSI, high social support, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low anxiety-related risk factors), and despite slight increases in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity between T1 and T2, there were also improvements in positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and no increase in general psychopathology—suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The person exhibited significant psychological distress and a likely psychological disorder already at T1, as evidenced by high stress, low self-efficacy and life satisfaction, high GSI, and risk factor elevations. Although some risk factors worsened and some protective factors improved at T2, this pattern suggests ongoing or persistent difficulties rather than the emergence of a new disorder."
1,"While there were some protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health and self-efficacy), the individual already had several risk factors (low social support, low life satisfaction, high stress, elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology). Between T1 and T2, there were drastic increases in risk factors—most notably, severe rises in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and a very large increase in general psychopathology—strongly indicating the development of a psychological disorder at T2."
0,"The individual started with some risk factors (low positive mental health, elevated anxiety sensitivity, and stress) but also strong protective factors (high social support, high self-efficacy, low dysfunctional attitudes, and below-average general psychopathology). Notably, between T1 and T2, most risk factors improve or remain stable (marked decrease in anxiety sensitivity, further decrease in general psychopathology), and although dysfunctional attitudes increase, there is no concurrent rise in overall distress; thus, there is no clear pattern indicating the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some initial risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, high anxiety sensitivity, high fear of bodily sensations), this person showed marked improvements in protective factors between T1 and T2 (large increases in positive mental health, general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with notable reductions in anxiety sensitivity and fear). Although there was a moderate increase in general psychopathology, the overall pattern is of improved psychological resilience, making new disorder onset unlikely."
1,"Although there were some improvements in protective factors such as positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction, the person started with high risk factors at T1 (very high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, low social support, low life satisfaction) and exhibited substantial increases between T1 and T2 in the key risk areas of anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and overall psychopathology, indicating likely development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although there was a large drop in positive mental health and life satisfaction, and a slight increase in general psychopathology and risk factors (anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), the baseline at T1 was highly protective (extremely high positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction, and very low dysfunctional attitudes). The small increases in psychopathology and risk factors are not sufficient to indicate new disorder development given the strong initial protective factors and generally moderate shifts."
0,"The person started with strong protective factors at T1—very low anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, high self-efficacy, low general psychopathology, and low dysfunctional attitudes. Although there are notable declines in life satisfaction and social support and a small rise in general psychopathology at T2, there are no dramatic increases in core risk factors or overall psychopathology indicating a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite significant risk factors at T1 (low education and socioeconomic status, low positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction, plus very high stress), there are notable protective changes toward T2: large improvements in social support and life satisfaction, reduced fear of bodily sensations and dysfunctional attitudes, and only negligible change in general psychopathology. Thus, the overall profile suggests recovery or resilience rather than new disorder development."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and a sharp drop in positive mental health, the person started with very high initial protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, very low dysfunctional attitudes, and low psychopathology) and showed substantial increases in social support and life satisfaction, while psychopathology actually decreased from T1 to T2, strongly indicating no new disorder developed."
1,"The person started with low protective factors (social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and socioeconomic status), and between T1 and T2 experienced substantial declines in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction) with a notable increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology, suggesting onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with some vulnerability (low positive mental health, self-efficacy, and social support, and elevated anxiety sensitivity), but showed clear improvements at T2 in most risk areas (notably increased positive mental health and self-efficacy, with large decreases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), despite a modest increase in overall psychopathology; there is no pattern of new disorder development."
0,"Despite large increases in risk factors (notably dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology), the individual already exhibited significant psychopathology at T1 (GSI, low life satisfaction, high stress, moderate coping, and low social support), indicating a pre-existing disorder; thus, there is no evidence for new onset between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual starts with relatively healthy baseline scores, marked by low general psychopathology, stress, and anxiety sensitivity, with only mildly elevated dysfunctional attitudes. Although there is a notable decrease in positive mental health and social support over time, as well as small increases in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology, the overall risk factor changes are modest and do not reach the levels typically associated with the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there was low positive mental health and general self-efficacy at T1, the individual experienced substantial increases in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, and especially self-efficacy) from T1 to T2, while risk factors and general psychopathology only showed minimal changes. There is no evidence of a shift to a clinically significant risk profile or distress, so no new psychological disorder likely developed."
0,"Despite some demographic risk factors (lower education and socioeconomic status) and a drop in life satisfaction at T2, the individual’s initial baseline was psychologically healthy, protective factors (self-efficacy, social support, problem-focused coping) remain strong, general psychopathology increases only minimally, and key risk variables (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) do not show concerning increases, supporting no new disorder development."
0,"The individual had good baseline mental health at T1, with strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, low stress, low anxiety sensitivity and fear, and low general psychopathology). Although there was a notable drop in self-efficacy and a small increase in dysfunctional attitudes, other protective factors (like social support) increased and general psychopathology decreased, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there are demographic risk factors (low education, high BMI, low socioeconomic status) and higher baseline fear of bodily sensations and stress, the person showed average-to-low general psychopathology at T1 and only moderate negative changes by T2 (slight GSI increase but improvements/consistency in mental health, coping, and life satisfaction). This pattern suggests ongoing vulnerability but not the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Despite initially strong protective factors (very high positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction at T1), this individual experienced a substantial decrease in life satisfaction and positive mental health, coupled with a large increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and dysfunctional attitudes at T2, suggesting the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and elevated risk factors at T1 (high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), key protective factors—particularly positive mental health—increase markedly from T1 to T2, while risk factors like GSI and dysfunctional attitudes remain essentially stable or even decrease. There is no significant rise in psychopathology, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there were increases in certain risk factors (e.g., dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations) and a sharp drop in self-efficacy, this person already had high general psychopathology (GSI) at T1, indicating an existing disorder. Their baseline was not healthy, so there is no evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started at T1 with exceptionally strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction, low psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), and although there was a slight decline in some protective factors and a small increase in risk factors by T2, these changes are not large enough nor do they reach a level of significant risk, so new disorder development is unlikely."
0,"The individual started with very high protective factors at T1 (notably extremely high positive mental health and above-average social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and no significant risk factors; most mental health variables improved or remained stable between T1 and T2, with general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes all decreasing, and no significant increase in risk, indicating no development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual already exhibited strong risk factors and severe psychopathology at T1, indicating the likely presence of a psychological disorder; while there is some worsening and increased dysfunctional attitudes by T2, this does not reflect the development of a new disorder but rather the continuation or progression of existing problems."
0,"The individual began with high protective factors (high positive mental health, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, coping, and social support) and low risk (below average psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes), and while there was a substantial drop in life satisfaction and self-efficacy and a moderate increase in dysfunctional attitudes, overall psychopathology remains only slightly increased and still likely below clinical threshold, with no strong shift toward increased risk across multiple domains."
0,"Despite high initial risk due to low socioeconomic status, low social support, and low self-efficacy at T1, there are substantial improvements in T2 in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, while key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations) decrease and general psychopathology shows only a modest increase, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Although there is an increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, most risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) actually decrease, and protective factors such as positive mental health, general self-efficacy, and coping strategies improve or remain stable. The individual started with only mild baseline vulnerability and improved in key areas, making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"Despite several risk factors at T1 (notably high anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and psychopathology), the individual experienced a dramatic decrease in general psychopathology and substantial increases in positive mental health, suggesting significant recovery rather than new disorder development."
0,"The individual had strong protective factors and low risk factors at T1, remained low in general psychopathology, and showed only mild increases in risk factors, but no significant deterioration or emergence of major risk markers—overall, there is no indication of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite significant risk factors at T1 (extremely low life satisfaction, high stress, elevated dysfunctional attitudes, and very high general psychopathology indicating likely ongoing psychological disorder), all major risk factors markedly improve by T2 (large decreases in GSI and dysfunctional attitudes, substantial increases in protective factors like life satisfaction and self-efficacy), indicating recovery rather than onset of a new disorder."
0,"Despite low education and socioeconomic status as demographic risk factors, the individual already exhibited significant psychopathology (high GSI) at T1, along with elevated anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, indicating pre-existing mental health challenges. There is substantial improvement in psychopathology by T2 (GSI and dysfunctional attitudes decrease notably), suggesting recovery or ongoing disorder rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite significant decreases in several protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support), risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes only changed modestly, and general psychopathology actually decreased. Given the average or slightly elevated baseline and no marked increase in key risk factors or overall psychopathology, there is no strong evidence for new disorder onset."
1,"The individual started with significant demographic risk factors (low education, BMI, and SES) and low protective factors at T1 (low social support, low self-efficacy, low coping, mild negative mental health indicators). There is a marked worsening in positive mental health and a large increase in general psychopathology (GSI) at T2, alongside a strong increase in dysfunctional attitudes, suggesting the emergence of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a decline in protective factors such as positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, the individual starts with strong demographic protective factors, low psychopathology at T1, and actually experiences a decrease in overall psychological distress from T1 to T2. There is no clear indication of developing a new psychological disorder, as risk factor increases are counterbalanced by improvements in life satisfaction and a reduction in GSI."
0,"Despite low positive mental health and elevated anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations at T1, strong protective factors (high education, strong social support, above-average self-efficacy, good coping, and low initial psychopathology) were present. Furthermore, from T1 to T2, most risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear, and psychopathology) decreased, and while some declines in protective factors occurred, there is no strong evidence for the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with mostly average-to-positive psychological health at T1, aside from notable high stress, and experienced declines in several protective factors (positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction), but also saw decreases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, general psychopathology). The decline in both risk and protective factors—without any rise in overall psychopathology—suggests no development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite starting with significant risk factors at T1 (very low protective factors, high anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations), this individual showed strong improvements in all key protective factors (mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) and strong reductions in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes) from T1 to T2. Although general psychopathology (GSI) increased, the overall shift from a high-risk baseline to improved resilience makes new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Despite extremely low protective factors and high dysfunctional attitudes at T1, the person already displays considerable mental health distress and impairment at baseline; the marked increase in general psychopathology at T2 suggests symptom worsening, but not the onset of a new disorder in someone previously healthy. The pattern is consistent with persistence or exacerbation of an existing issue, rather than new disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"The person started with strong protective factors (high general self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, low stress, low psychopathology) and over time saw general improvements (increased positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, with reduced dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology), indicating continued psychological health and no development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite a moderate increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, the person started with low risk (low GSI, low anxiety sensitivity, low dysfunctional attitudes, negative stress) and showed strong improvements in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and social support, with no dramatic shifts toward risk factors indicative of new disorder development."
1,"The person started with several protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low psychopathology), but had consistently low demographic protective factors (all -1), high initial stress, and poor coping abilities. Critically, they experienced substantial increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and psychopathology), alongside decreases in life satisfaction and self-efficacy, suggesting new onset of psychological disorder by T2."
0,"Despite substantial risk factors at T1 (very low social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, high dysfunctional attitudes/anxiety/fear), the large increase in positive mental health and only moderate rises in general psychopathology (GSI) suggest a shift toward resilience rather than disorder onset; T1 already displayed significant distress, indicating issues were ongoing rather than newly developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there was a significant drop in positive mental health and continued low social support, the individual started with several risk factors and some signs of distress (elevated GSI, high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations). However, the substantial reduction in GSI (overall distress), anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations from T1 to T2, combined with stable or only slightly worsened protective factors, strongly suggests no new psychological disorder emerged."
1,"The individual started with robust protective factors (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, coping, social support, and low psychopathology at T1), but experienced a dramatic increase in general psychopathology (GSI) alongside marked drops in self-efficacy and life satisfaction between T1 and T2—indicating likely onset of psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with low positive mental health but had high social support, good self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low anxiety sensitivity, and very low general psychopathology, with no strong risk factors at T1. Despite a slight increase in general psychopathology at T2 and some decrease in social support, positive mental health and most protective factors improved or remained stable, and there is no substantial evidence of new disorder development."
0,"The individual started with high protective factors (especially high self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction, and very low psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes), and although there was a notable drop in several protective factors and a moderate increase in psychopathology by T2, their baseline mental health was very strong and the changes, while negative, do not suggest the development of a psychological disorder but rather a reduction in well-being."
0,"The individual began with below-average positive mental health, self-efficacy, and coping, but marked risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology were all substantially below average, indicating psychological stability. Although there was a notable decline in protective factors (especially social support, life satisfaction, and further drop in positive mental health) and a modest rise in psychopathology, the changes aren't sufficient to indicate the development of a new disorder given the initially robust absence of risk and only moderate change in symptoms."
0,"Although there are several risk factors at T1 (very high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), the individual showed low baseline general psychopathology and stress, and over time actually improved on most risk factors (substantial decreases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations). Despite decreased social support and life satisfaction and a slight rise in general psychopathology, there is not enough evidence to suggest the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person started with some elevated risk factors at T1 (lower self-efficacy, higher anxiety sensitivity, mildly elevated dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI slightly above average), but showed increased protective factors and decreased risk factors at T2, including higher positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, alongside notable reductions in general psychopathology and anxiety sensitivity. This overall positive shift indicates they did not develop a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there is a sharp increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and a large decrease in self-efficacy, the person maintained strong protective factors at T1 (high life satisfaction, self-efficacy, low stress, high social support, and low initial psychopathology). The overall risk profile does not indicate a clear shift from healthy to disorder, despite elevated symptoms at T2, suggesting possible subclinical distress or relapse from a previously vulnerable (dysfunctional attitudes) but not disordered state."
0,"Although the individual had some initial risk factors at T1, including low socioeconomic status, low positive mental health, and moderate anxiety sensitivity, there were also important protective factors present (low stress, supportive coping styles, average to positive self-efficacy, and low overall psychopathology). While several risk factors worsened between T1 and T2 (notably anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), general psychopathology only increased slightly and remained below average, indicating subclinical changes rather than clear development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there is a marked increase in general psychopathology from T1 to T2, this individual started with above-average protective factors (education, positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction), and most risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) actually decreased, especially dysfunctional attitudes (strong protective change). The overall pattern suggests stress or worsening distress, but not the new onset of a diagnosable psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had several risk factors at T1 (very high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, high dysfunctional attitudes, and low self-efficacy) but no clear evidence of a psychological disorder at baseline. Between T1 and T2, most risk factors decreased sharply (e.g., anxiety sensitivity and overall psychopathology), and protective factors (such as self-efficacy and life satisfaction) improved, making new disorder onset highly unlikely."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 (high stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and GSI), the person already appeared to have psychological difficulties at baseline, indicating they were not healthy at T1. The increase in GSI and dysfunctional attitudes at T2 suggests worsening symptoms, but this represents a possible ongoing or worsening disorder rather than the development of a new one."
0,"Despite some deterioration in protective factors (notably life satisfaction and self-efficacy) and a moderate increase in general psychopathology, the individual started with high protective factors, well below-average risk factors, and remains overall psychologically resilient; there is no strong indication of new disorder development given the magnitude and context of these changes."
0,"Although there was a substantial increase in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, the person already had a high level of general psychopathology (GSI) at T1, indicating the likely presence of a disorder at baseline. Furthermore, general psychopathology decreased between T1 and T2, and other risk factors such as general self-efficacy improved, so this pattern does not support the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status (risk factor) and some increases in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology at T2, the individual started with strong protective factors—very low GSI, low stress, low dysfunctional attitudes, and increased self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and positive mental health from T1 to T2. The overall pattern suggests improved well-being and resilience, making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"The person already exhibited marked psychological difficulties and significant psychopathology at T1, including extremely low social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, alongside high stress and GSI, indicating they likely had an ongoing psychological disorder at T1 rather than developing a new one at T2. Despite some worsening in social support and general psychopathology, these changes reflect continuation or slight aggravation of an existing disorder rather than the onset of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Although the individual had some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, high anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations), they exhibited low general psychopathology. From T1 to T2 there was an extremely large increase in general psychopathology, along with increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes). This substantial worsening strongly suggests the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual showed strong protective factors at T1, such as high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with very low risk factors—including low psychopathology, stress, anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes. Although there is an increase in GSI and some risk factors from T1 to T2, the baseline psychological health was robust, and the changes do not strongly indicate the onset of a new psychological disorder, merely an increase in distress that does not necessarily meet diagnostic threshold."
0,"Despite a significant drop in general self-efficacy and life satisfaction, the person started with strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, low stress, low general psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes), and only modest increases in risk factors and general psychopathology occur by T2. There is no evidence of substantial or multifaceted risk factor elevation or disturbance that strongly suggests the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual displayed strong protective factors at T1—high social support, self-efficacy, and problem-focused coping—with only mild negative indicators. Between T1 and T2, despite small increases in risk factors (fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes), key protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction) increased markedly and general psychopathology decreased, indicating sustained or improved psychological health rather than new disorder development."
0,"While the individual started with low positive mental health and self-efficacy and elevated stress, they had strong social support and life satisfaction at T1, minimal psychopathology, and significant positive changes between T1 and T2: sharp increases in self-efficacy, reductions in dysfunctional attitudes and psychopathology, and improved positive mental health, all indicating low likelihood of developing a new disorder."
0,"The person started at T1 with low positive mental health but strong social support, good self-efficacy, above-average life satisfaction, low psychological distress, and low anxiety/fear levels. From T1 to T2, core protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction, self-efficacy) improved substantially, and risk factors like anxiety sensitivity decreased, with only a small increase in general psychopathology—these changes collectively suggest no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite lower education and socioeconomic status (risk factors), the individual started with highly protective T1 psychological characteristics (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, very low anxiety/fear/dysfunction), and although some protective factors decreased slightly and GSI increased modestly, overall changes do not cross into a ""disordered"" pattern nor suggest the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual starts with several risk factors, including lower education and socioeconomic status, low life satisfaction, moderate stress, and low social support. Critically, from T1 to T2, there are large declines in social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and positive mental health, paired with a substantial rise in psychological distress (GSI). This pattern indicates the likely development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite increased anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations at T2, this individual started with strong protective factors (high life satisfaction, low stress, high self-efficacy, and low dysfunctional attitudes) and improved social support, while general psychopathology actually decreased, collectively suggesting resilience against developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low education (a demographic risk), the individual had relatively good baseline mental health at T1 (low distress, high self-efficacy, and low psychopathology/risk factors). All key protective psychological variables (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) increased substantially at T2, while dysfunctional attitudes decreased and only a moderate GSI increase was observed—indicating improvement and no development of a new disorder."
1,"Although the person began with extremely low social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction (significant risk factors), their psychological distress (GSI) at T1 was only slightly below average. However, there is a very large increase in general psychopathology (GSI +2.40 SD), along with sharp rises in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, indicating a substantial development of psychopathological symptoms and supporting the onset of a new psychological disorder at T2."
0,"The individual had low positive mental health and life satisfaction and high stress at T1, but also exhibited strong protective factors such as very low anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology. From T1 to T2, most risk factors remained low or improved, with only a mild increase in general psychopathology and a small decrease in life satisfaction—overall, there is no substantial evidence of new disorder development."
0,"Although there is a notable loss of social support and increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, the person began with a relatively healthy baseline (moderate positive mental health, low psychopathology) and experienced increases in life satisfaction at T2 with only marginal increases in general psychopathology, suggesting they did not develop a new psychological disorder."
1,"The person was initially mildly distressed but not disordered at T1, though they showed significant risk factors (very low social support, very low life satisfaction, high dysfunctional attitudes). The sharp increases between T1 and T2 in general psychopathology (GSI), anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations, alongside a dramatic drop in self-efficacy (a typically strong protective factor), indicate the likely onset of a new psychological disorder by T2."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1, including high socioeconomic status, self-efficacy, low psychopathology, and very low risk factors. Although some protective factors diminished and dysfunctional attitudes increased, overall risk remained moderate and general psychopathology at T2 likely did not rise enough to indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with above-average positive mental health and life satisfaction, low general psychopathology, and experienced increased social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction over time. While there was a notable decline in positive mental health and a moderate increase in general psychopathology, strong protective factors at baseline, reduced dysfunctional attitudes and fear, along with improved support and self-efficacy, suggest they did not develop a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started with several protective factors at T1—including above-average positive mental health, high self-efficacy, and notably low risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes)—but also showed significant risk factors: markedly low social support, high stress, and very low life satisfaction. Critically, between T1 and T2, there were large negative declines in positive mental health and social support, and increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology (GSI), all of which collectively suggest the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The person demonstrates substantial improvements in protective factors between T1 and T2—most notably, very large increases in positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, alongside a significant drop in dysfunctional attitudes. Although some risk factors at T1 (elevated anxiety sensitivity, low self-efficacy) are present, these are more than compensated for by the strong positive shifts, and there is no notable increase in general psychopathology, indicating no new disorder developed."
0,"Despite very low social support and high dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity at T1, there are no increases in major risk factors, psychological distress actually decreases, and there are notable positive changes in life satisfaction and social support by T2, making new disorder development unlikely."
1,"Although the person started with high protective factors (well above-average positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support, and socioeconomic status), there was a substantial increase in risk factors between T1 and T2, including a marked rise in anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology (GSI), along with a significant drop in life satisfaction, all suggesting the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some initial risk factors (low education, low positive mental health, high stress), this individual had strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, high self-efficacy, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes), and between T1 and T2, key protective variables such as positive mental health, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy all increased. There is only a slight rise in general psychopathology and risk factors, with no major worsening to suggest the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low education and socioeconomic status (risk factors), the individual started with good social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low psychopathology, low anxiety sensitivity, and few dysfunctional attitudes (protective baseline). Although positive mental health slightly declined and GSI rose modestly at T2, increases were minor, baseline risk was low, and protective factors remained, making the development of a new disorder unlikely."
1,"Although this person started with several risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction; above-average stress; and low self-efficacy), their most notable change is a very large increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, accompanied by increased anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, which together strongly indicate the development of a psychological disorder by T2."
0,"The individual showed moderate protective factors at T1 (above-average social support and life satisfaction, low stress, some self-efficacy) with slightly elevated risk in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations but overall low psychopathology. From T1 to T2, most risk factors did not increase—GSI (overall distress) and dysfunctional attitudes actually decreased, and life satisfaction and positive mental health improved, making it unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The person had very low risk at T1—consistently low scores on risk factors (stress, psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) and below-average but not risk-connoting values on protective factors. Although there were some increases in risk between T1 and T2 (notably a large drop in self-efficacy, large increases in dysfunctional attitudes and GSI), there is no indication the baseline moved from a subclinical to a clinical threshold; the initial scores were highly protective, so even with these changes, the absolute risk of developing a new disorder remains low."
0,"Despite some demographic risk factors (low education and SES, high BMI), the individual had a healthy baseline at T1 (good mental health, social support, low stress, and negative GSI). While protective factors decreased slightly and social support dropped notably from T1 to T2, there was no major rise in risk factors or general psychopathology, so there is insufficient evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Although protective factors like positive mental health and social support increased significantly at T2, the extremely large increase in general psychopathology (GSI) indicates a marked rise in overall psychological distress, strongly suggesting the onset of a new psychological disorder despite variable improvements in other areas."
0,"The individual already exhibited elevated psychopathology and significant risk factors (high anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology) at T1, suggesting a pre-existing psychological disorder rather than the development of a new one between T1 and T2. Although their mental health declined further by T2, the pattern is consistent with an ongoing disorder, not the new onset of one."
0,"Despite some risk factors at baseline (notably elevated general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, and fear of bodily sensations), the large decrease in general psychopathology from T1 to T2 suggests significant recovery or improvement, rather than the onset of a new disorder. There is no clear pattern supporting the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual began with several risk factors (low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, elevated anxiety sensitivity, very high fear of bodily sensations, and above-average general psychopathology) and experienced a marked increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and anxiety sensitivity from T1 to T2. Despite some improvements in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy), the overall deterioration in key risk variables and a substantial rise in general psychopathology strongly indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this individual starts out with some demographic risk factors (lower education and socioeconomic status) and low positive mental health at T1, they show a significant improvement in positive mental health over time, and risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes decrease. While there is a drop in self-efficacy and a slight increase in general psychopathology, the overall protective trends and absence of major symptom spikes suggest that the person did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started out with substantial protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health, high social support, low dysfunctional attitudes, low general psychopathology), and although there were some declines in positive mental health and self-efficacy, there were no meaningful increases in general psychopathology or dysfunctional attitudes by T2, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite low education (a risk factor) and initially below-average positive mental health and self-efficacy, the individual had high life satisfaction, low psychological distress, and some social support at T1. Over time, most risk factors decreased (dysfunctional attitudes and GSI went down, anxiety sensitivity remained low), and there were no significant increases in indicators of psychopathology; thus, the evidence does not suggest onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual began with relatively good mental health, high social support, low stress, and low psychopathology, and over time even showed improvements in key protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) and decreases in risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, general psychopathology), despite low socioeconomic status. Overall, there is no indication of new psychological disorder development."
0,"The person started with low positive mental health and coping at T1 but showed a large improvement in positive mental health and consistently low levels of key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes) from T1 to T2; no major increases in general psychopathology or other risk indicators suggest the individual did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this individual starts at T1 with lower positive mental health and life satisfaction—both risk factors—the person demonstrates strong self-efficacy, adequate coping, and low stress, with no marked T1 psychopathology. Despite a drop in positive mental health and life satisfaction by T2 and a moderate increase in general psychopathology, protective factors such as increased social support and maintained high self-efficacy, as well as decreases in key risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, make it unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The individual started with notable risk factors at T1 (low socioeconomic status, low self-efficacy and life satisfaction, high GSI), but showed substantial improvements in protective factors (increased positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and strong decreases in risk factors (lower dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and GSI) by T2, indicating recovery rather than new disorder onset."
0,"The individual started with some mildly low positive mental health and life satisfaction, but also had low psychopathology, strong protective low anxiety sensitivity and fear, and moderate self-efficacy. From T1 to T2, there were improvements in most protective factors (increased social support, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy) and decreases in risk factors (lower dysfunctional attitudes and GSI), making it unlikely they developed a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some initial risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, self-efficacy, high anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes), the individual has strong protective demographic factors (high education and socioeconomic status), low baseline stress and psychopathology, and showed decreases in nearly all key risk factors between T1 and T2. Although GSI increased slightly, it remained below average, indicating no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite high risk factors and probable disorder at T1 (low positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; high anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI), nearly all risk factors and distress indicators improved or remained stable between T1 and T2, with marked reductions in psychopathology (GSI) and increases in positive mental health and social support, indicating recovery or ongoing disorder rather than new onset."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 (elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, as well as low positive mental health and self-efficacy), there is no evidence for a new disorder developing, as most risk factors decrease or remain stable from T1 to T2 and general psychopathology, while modestly increased, does not indicate a shift from health to disorder; the baseline pattern suggests ongoing challenges rather than new onset."
0,"Despite high stress and very low life satisfaction at T1, the individual started with strong protective factors such as high positive mental health, social support, and extremely low anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations; between T1 and T2, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and social support all improved and psychopathology increased only moderately from a healthy baseline, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"At T1, the individual already exhibited strong risk factors and high psychopathology (notably high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI), indicating an existing psychological disorder rather than a new onset. Though positive mental health sharply declines, core risk factors are actually reduced at T2, and GSI drops substantially—so no new disorder develops between T1 and T2."
0,"This individual already exhibited highly elevated psychological distress and risk factors at T1 (very high GSI, stress, dysfunctional attitudes, and anxiety sensitivity), indicating an existing psychological disorder; key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, GSI, fear of bodily sensations) decreased from T1 to T2, so there is no evidence of development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although the individual begins with several risk factors at T1 (high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes) and low socioeconomic status, these risk factors substantially decrease by T2, while protective factors like social support increase and overall psychopathology remains below average despite a slight rise. The overall pattern suggests no new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some demographic risk factors (lower education and socioeconomic status, higher BMI), at T1 the individual demonstrated strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress and psychopathology), with only anxiety sensitivity elevated as a risk factor. From T1 to T2, key protective factors declined (notably a large decrease in self-efficacy and life satisfaction), but risk factors (especially anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes) also slightly improved and there was only a minimal increase in general psychopathology—thus, there is insufficient evidence of the significant deterioration typically associated with the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although socioeconomic status is low (risk factor), the individual had good baseline mental health at T1 (elevated life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support, low distress and dysfunctional attitudes), and from T1 to T2 saw strong improvements in positive mental health, social support, and prominent reductions in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations. Despite a marked increase in dysfunctional attitudes (risk factor), general psychopathology remained low and even slightly decreased, making the overall pattern not indicative of new disorder development."
0,"The person already exhibited high levels of psychological distress and several risk factors at T1, indicating an existing disorder; although some protective factors slightly improved by T2, there is no evidence of a new onset of disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person already showed clinically significant psychological distress at T1 (GSI very high), indicating an ongoing disorder rather than a new onset at T2; additionally, risk factors generally improved between T1 and T2, with GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, and anxiety sensitivity all substantially decreasing and protective factors increasing."
0,"The individual begins with some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, very low self-efficacy, low socioeconomic status), but overall displays protective factors such as low anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, mild stress, and low psychopathology. From T1 to T2, protective factors generally increase (notably self-efficacy and life satisfaction), risk factors further decrease (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), and psychopathology is stable, which together suggest no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual started with multiple strong risk factors at T1 (low socioeconomic status, extremely low self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support, high stress and psychopathology), all key protective factors significantly improved from T1 to T2 (notably large increases in positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction, and a marked decrease in general psychopathology), indicating recovery or substantial positive change rather than new disorder onset."
0,"Despite some increases in anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes between T1 and T2, the protective factors at baseline (high socioeconomic status, above-average social support, adequate life satisfaction, and low general psychopathology), along with a decrease in overall psychopathology at T2, suggest that this individual did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with a healthy psychological profile at T1—very low risk factors (strongly negative anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and near-average GSI) and strong protective factors (above-average life satisfaction, good coping). At T2, nearly all protective factors increased further (large increases in positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy), risk factors increased only modestly and stayed low, and general psychopathology remained below average, indicating no evidence of new disorder development."
0,"Despite a low socioeconomic status and a moderate increase in general psychopathology, the individual started with high self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction, and further improved life satisfaction at T2. Decreases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and fear of bodily sensations) along with consistently low psychopathology at baseline suggest resilience and no evidence of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person began with high protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, low stress, and low psychopathology) and, though positive mental health dropped sharply and dysfunctional attitudes increased, there were no substantial rises in key risk factors such as general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, or fear; the overall psychological distress remains low, suggesting no new disorder developed."
1,"The person started with excellent positive mental health, low distress, and strong protective factors at T1, but experienced a dramatic decline in positive mental health and social support, along with a large increase in general psychopathology (GSI) at T2, signaling the likely onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual presented multiple risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, high stress, high fear of bodily sensations, moderate anxiety sensitivity) and experienced decreases in life satisfaction and increases in dysfunctional attitudes by T2, their protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, positive mental health) improved, and general psychopathology increased only slightly from below average and remains low; there is not enough evidence of a clear onset of a new disorder."
0,"Although there is a significant decline in protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support) and a substantial increase in general psychopathology, the person already showed elevated risk factors at T1 (high anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, low social support) but remained below the threshold for general psychopathology, indicating ongoing vulnerability rather than the development of a new disorder. The changes likely represent worsening of an already vulnerable state rather than new disorder onset."
0,"Although the person began with low protective factors (low socioeconomic status, positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy) and some mild vulnerability (slightly elevated dysfunctional attitudes), their mental health indicators improved or remained stable from T1 to T2 (notably, positive mental health, self-efficacy, and social support increased and psychopathology only minimally increased), suggesting no clear development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The person started with a highly protected profile at T1 (strong positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, extremely low distress and risk factors), but experienced substantial drops in all protective factors and a dramatic increase in dysfunctional attitudes, suggesting a transition from mental health to likely development of a psychological disorder by T2."
0,"The individual starts with elevated risk factors at T1—high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and moderate psychopathology—yet their protective factors (notably high social support and life satisfaction) are strong; from T1 to T2, all major risk factors and psychopathology significantly decrease, while there is only a moderate decline in protective factors. This trend indicates recovery or improvement rather than the emergence of a new disorder."
0,"Despite low self-efficacy, high stress, and high anxiety/fear at T1, there are significant protective factors—such as excellent baseline positive mental health and socioeconomic status, and substantial improvements in social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction by T2—along with only minimal increases in general psychopathology, indicating no new psychological disorder developed."
1,"The individual started with multiple risk factors at T1, including low positive mental health, low life satisfaction, low self-efficacy, and low socioeconomic status, but without a psychological disorder (GSI only slightly above average). From T1 to T2, pronounced increases in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology signal a significant negative shift, indicating the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started out psychologically healthy at T1, with strong protective factors (very high life satisfaction, low stress, low psychopathology, strong social support, low anxiety sensitivity and fear), and while there were small increases in general psychopathology and fear of bodily sensations by T2, key protective factors (self-efficacy, life satisfaction) remained high, and no risk factors showed large enough increases to suggest the development of a new disorder."
0,"The individual started with low risk at T1 (very low general psychopathology, stress, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations, high life satisfaction, and social support). Although there's some decrease in social support and an increase in dysfunctional attitudes and GSI, the changes are moderate and baseline protective factors remain strong, making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"Despite demographic risk factors (low education and SES), the individual showed high positive mental health and very high self-efficacy at T1, and although there was a marked decline in positive mental health and self-efficacy by T2, this was offset by substantial improvements in social support, life satisfaction, and a strong reduction in general psychopathology (GSI). These positive shifts indicate recovery or improved functioning rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this individual started with low education (risk factor), their T1 mental health profile was characterized by high stress, maladaptive attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and moderate distress, already suggesting the presence of psychological difficulties. However, from T1 to T2, there were significant improvements: large drops in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, overall psychopathology (GSI), and a notable increase in self-efficacy and life satisfaction, despite a sharp drop in positive mental health; thus, there is no evidence for the onset of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual began with relatively good mental health and self-efficacy but low social support and elevated stress. By T2, there is a notable increase in general psychopathology, a sharp decline in life satisfaction, and a substantial rise in dysfunctional attitudes—together indicating the likely development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with some risk factors (low positive mental health, high stress, low life satisfaction), but had strong protective factors (good social support, self-efficacy, low psychopathology, very low dysfunctional attitudes). Between T1 and T2, protective factors further increased (notably self-efficacy and life satisfaction), risk factors either remained low or improved, and overall psychopathology actually decreased, suggesting no new disorder developed."
1,"The person was psychologically healthy at T1, with high protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, low stress, low psychopathology), but experienced drastic losses in protective factors and a very large increase in general psychopathology (GSI) by T2, strongly suggesting the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Although the person started with very strong protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction, low stress, and low overall psychological distress), there was a marked increase in key risk factors by T2, including large rises in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology—suggesting the likely development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a poor initial psychological profile at T1 (high stress, very low coping, high anxiety sensitivity and fear, above-average GSI), the individual did not worsen and actually showed substantial decreases in key risk factors (marked drops in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and GSI) and increases in protective factors (notably social support and life satisfaction). These trends suggest either ongoing or improving psychological health rather than the new development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"Although the individual began with notable protective factors (higher self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress and general psychopathology), their low socioeconomic status, education, and BMI increased baseline risk. Critically, there was a marked increase in general psychopathology (GSI), a notable rise in dysfunctional attitudes, and a sharp decline in social support between T1 and T2, indicating development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low education and socioeconomic status (risk factors), the person showed strong initial protective factors (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support; low psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes), and most psychological measures either improved or remained stable from T1 to T2—while GSI increased moderately, there is no clear pattern of decompensation or major increase in risk factors, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite extremely high general psychopathology and stress at T1 (indicating a pre-existing disorder), the person showed significant improvement by T2, with large decreases in psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and increases in positive mental health, life satisfaction, and social support; these patterns suggest recovery or ongoing symptoms, not development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual started with a healthy profile at T1, but between T1 and T2, they experienced significant decreases in social support and self-efficacy, along with sharp increases in dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology—risk factors that indicate the likely development of a new psychological disorder at T2."
0,"Although this individual started with multiple risk factors, including low education, low socioeconomic status, very low positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and coping at T1, their risk factors either remained stable or slightly improved between T1 and T2 (notably increased social support and improved positive mental health). Most importantly, there is no increase in general psychopathology (GSI actually decreased), and no significant rise in central risk factors such as dysfunctional attitudes or overall distress, indicating no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The individual showed substantial psychological distress and several risk factors already present at T1 (high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, elevated GSI, very low social support, low life satisfaction), indicating an existing mental health problem rather than the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2. While changes suggest some worsening (particularly GSI and dysfunctional attitudes), these shifts are from an already at-risk baseline, so this does not reflect the onset of a new disorder but rather the continuation or exacerbation of an existing one."
0,"Although there are some demographic risk factors (low BMI, low socioeconomic status), the person had high protective factors at T1 (strong self-efficacy, social support, and coping, and very low dysfunctional attitudes), and risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations decreased sharply by T2. Despite a drop in social support and self-efficacy, general psychopathology only increased slightly and life satisfaction improved, so there is no clear pattern indicating the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this person started with low education and socioeconomic status (risk factors) and showed several T1 vulnerabilities (low life satisfaction, self-efficacy, high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), their psychological health actually improved between T1 and T2: general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations all decreased, while life satisfaction, social support, and self-efficacy increased. These positive changes suggest recovery or resilience rather than development of a new disorder."
0,"Despite low education and socioeconomic status (demographic risk factors), this person began with strong protective psychological factors: high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and coping skills, plus low anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes, and psychopathology. While there was a notable drop in life satisfaction, most other protective factors remained positive or improved, and psychopathology only minimally increased, so there is no clear evidence for new disorder development."
0,"Despite dramatic decreases in positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction, the individual started with exceptionally high protective factors and low risk factors at T1, and there was no increase in general psychopathology (GSI) or dysfunctional attitudes—in fact, these decreased. The individual remains below average on key disorder risk indices at T2, indicating no new disorder developed."
0,"The person already showed clear signs of psychological distress and risk at T1—including very high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and above-average psychopathology—so the marked increase in general psychopathology at T2 likely represents an ongoing or worsening disorder rather than the development of a new one. Thus, they did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2; they were already at clinical risk at T1."
0,"Although there are some demographic risk factors (lower education and socioeconomic status), the individual started T1 with strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and very low psychopathology and risk factors). While life satisfaction decreased and GSI increased slightly at T2, positive mental health, self-efficacy, and risk factors like dysfunctional attitudes and fear of bodily sensations improved or stayed low, making it unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite initial risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and relatively high dysfunctional attitudes), protective changes are observed by T2 such as substantial increases in self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and decreases in anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology, suggesting improved resilience and a decreased likelihood of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some demographic and baseline risk factors (low education, low socioeconomic status, low initial mental health and life satisfaction), the individual showed strong improvements in social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction by T2. Although there is a notable increase in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, the presence of multiple substantial protective changes and the initial low level of psychopathology suggest the pattern is more consistent with increased distress rather than clear development of a new disorder."
0,"The person started with low risk for developing a psychological disorder due to very low psychopathology, low stress, low anxiety sensitivity and fear, and high self-efficacy, despite low socioeconomic status and social support. At T2, their protective factors increased sharply (notably in self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction), and no substantial new risk factor emerged, so there is no evidence for new disorder onset."
0,"Despite severe psychological distress and several risk factors already present at T1 (high stress, psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and low life satisfaction), there is clear evidence of substantial improvement by T2 (marked increases in social support and life satisfaction, strong decreases in dysfunctional attitudes and GSI), indicating either ongoing or recovering psychopathology rather than the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although this person started with moderate risk due to high stress and psychopathology at T1, their overall risk was mitigated by strong protective factors (high education, socioeconomic status, social support, and life satisfaction). Importantly, their general psychopathology decreased significantly by T2, and despite some increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, there is no clear pattern of new disorder development—rather, the overall psychological distress lessened from T1 to T2."
0,"Despite some initial risk factors at T1 (low socioeconomic status, high anxiety sensitivity, low life satisfaction, and elevated stress), the individual experienced significant improvements in self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and reductions in anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes by T2, with no notable increase in overall psychopathology, indicating they did not develop a psychological disorder."
1,"Despite initially healthy and resilient baseline mental health, the individual experienced a dramatic increase in general psychopathology, large declines in life satisfaction and social support, and increased dysfunctional attitudes, all on top of low socioeconomic status—strongly suggesting the development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The person had subclinical risk at T1 with moderately high stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology, but was not clearly disordered. Between T1 and T2, general self-efficacy, positive mental health, and life satisfaction declined significantly, and general psychopathology increased markedly—suggesting the onset of a psychological disorder despite some reduction in specific anxieties."
0,"The person started with a strong protective profile at T1 (low psychopathology, high social support, low stress, very low risk-factor variables), and despite moderate increases in risk factors and general psychopathology at T2, the overall levels of dysfunction appear unlikely to have reached the threshold for a new psychological disorder; increases are notable but not dramatic enough for a diagnostic shift given the very low baseline risk."
0,"Although there was a dramatic drop in positive mental health and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, there were substantial increases in protective factors (notably, self-efficacy) and considerable decreases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology). These positive changes, together with no increase in overall psychopathology, suggest the individual did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with only mildly elevated stress and low life satisfaction at T1, yet had adaptive characteristics such as high social support and self-efficacy, low dysfunctional attitudes, and average GSI; from T1 to T2, nearly all risk factors decreased while protective factors improved, and general psychopathology notably decreased, indicating no onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual started with extremely high risk factors and substantial psychological distress at T1, their mental health indicators (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) improved markedly by T2, and overall psychopathology decreased substantially, indicating no new disorder developed—instead, likely partial recovery from pre-existing problems."
1,"Although the individual started with extraordinarily high protective factors at T1 (very high life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support, positive mental health, and low risk factors), they experienced pronounced decreases in key protective factors (notably, a large drop in self-efficacy and moderate declines in positive mental health and life satisfaction), coupled with substantial increases in risk factors (notably, a very strong rise in dysfunctional attitudes and a moderate rise in anxiety sensitivity), alongside increased general psychopathology; this shift from strong resilience towards greater vulnerability strongly suggests the development of a psychological disorder by T2."
0,"Despite a decrease in protective factors such as positive mental health, general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, as well as low socioeconomic status, the individual exhibited high protective factors and low psychopathology at T1, improved social support, strong reductions in risk factors (fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes), and a significant decrease in general psychopathology at T2; these changes do not indicate onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this person had below-average positive mental health and moderate psychopathology at T1, they showed marked improvements in most protective factors by T2—including substantial increases in self-efficacy, life satisfaction, reduced general psychopathology, and stable or improved coping and risk factors. There is no evidence of new disorder development; rather, mental health indicators improved over time."
1,"The person had somewhat low positive mental health and self-efficacy at T1 but was overall psychologically healthy, with low psychopathology. However, sharp increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and especially a strong rise in general psychopathology between T1 and T2 indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person already exhibited low positive mental health at T1, but had strong protective factors including above average social support, general self-efficacy, and low general psychopathology. Between T1 and T2, risk factors did not increase meaningfully, while protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, and especially life satisfaction) improved and psychopathology remained low, which supports the conclusion that no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Although the individual has notable risk factors at T1 (very low life satisfaction, high dysfunctional attitudes, and high general psychopathology), these indicate ongoing problems rather than the development of a new disorder. There is no evidence of a transition from health to disorder between T1 and T2—instead, some risk factors (notably general psychopathology) decrease, suggesting recovery or persistent symptoms rather than new onset."
0,"Although there is a low socioeconomic status (risk) and increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology from T1 to T2, the person began with exceptionally low psychopathology and high protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, satisfaction, very low risk/negative attitudes, very low GSI). The increases are notable but not sufficient in magnitude or overall level to suggest development of a new psychological disorder—they remain within a healthy range."
0,"Despite low education and somewhat negative T1 levels on mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, the individual starts psychologically healthy (very low GSI) and displays strong improvements in almost all protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) from T1 to T2; although some risk factors (anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes) rise, overall GSI remains well below average and does not suggest emergence of a new disorder at T2."
0,"Although there are some concerning increases in risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, GSI), the individual shows dramatic improvements in positive mental health and social support, and maintained average or improved protective factors. These changes outweigh the risk factor increases, making it unlikely a new disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual showed strong protective factors at T1, including high positive mental health and social support, low stress, and low dysfunctional attitudes, and their positive mental health and life satisfaction further improved by T2. Risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology decreased, indicating a lowered risk for the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had poor mental health and social support at T1 but showed strong improvements in positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction by T2, with a decrease in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, indicating stabilization or recovery rather than the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite demographic risk factors (lower education and socioeconomic status) and very low positive mental health and self-efficacy at T1, there are strong protective factors (very high life satisfaction, high social support, low anxiety sensitivity, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low overall psychopathology). Key T1-to-T2 changes indicate substantial improvements in positive mental health and stability in risk factors, with only a small increase in GSI that does not suggest the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a significant increase in some risk factors (fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, general psychopathology), the person already had somewhat elevated general psychopathology and very low life satisfaction at T1, indicating possible ongoing difficulties rather than a clean healthy baseline; moreover, improvements in protective factors (large increases in life satisfaction, positive mental health, and social support) suggest that, overall, this is not a clear case of a new disorder developing between T1 and T2."
0,"The person showed some risk factors at T1 (lower positive mental health, higher fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), but between T1 and T2, most risk factors decreased substantially and several protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy) increased, with no meaningful rise in general psychopathology—suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there are substantial increases in key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), and a large drop in self-efficacy and social support, the large decrease in general psychopathology (GSI) between T1 and T2 indicates that overall psychological distress has actually improved, making the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2 unlikely."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and high initial stress, the individual showed improved positive mental health and social support, stable or reduced risk factors (decreased dysfunctional attitudes and GSI), and no significant increase in psychopathological indicators between T1 and T2, making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and minor risk indicators at T1 (moderately elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, stress, and very low life satisfaction), T2 shows overall improvements: increased life satisfaction, substantial decreases in anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, with no signs of worsening risk factors. This pattern is inconsistent with the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and education, the person had strong protective factors at T1 (very high positive mental health, social support, general self-efficacy, and low psychopathology). The drop in positive mental health at T2 is notable, but other risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) stayed low or became even lower, and general psychopathology, while increased, likely remains below clinical threshold; overall, the profile does not indicate new disorder onset."
0,"Although there are increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology from T1 to T2, the person started at T1 with high protective factors (self-efficacy, problem-focused coping, life satisfaction, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes), and developed stronger positive mental health as well as maintained social support. The magnitudes of negative changes are moderate and the individual had no significant baseline vulnerabilities, suggesting the overall profile remains resilient against developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual experienced a notable decline in protective factors such as positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, as well as a moderate increase in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), their initial baseline at T1 showed strong protective factors (high positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support, and low dysfunctional attitudes). The increase in risk factors and general psychopathology is moderate and does not reach extreme levels, so it is unlikely a new psychological disorder developed; instead, this pattern suggests moderate distress or subclinical symptoms."
0,"Despite moderate initial risk factors (low positive mental health, self-efficacy, and elevated stress at T1), the individual starts with strong protective factors (high social support, life satisfaction, and low dysfunctional attitudes/psychopathology), and shows improvements in key areas such as positive mental health and self-efficacy over time. The small increases in some risk variables are minor and not of a magnitude or direction to indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some baseline risk factors (low socioeconomic status, low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, moderate stress and psychopathology at T1), all key risk variables (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) significantly decreased at T2, and general psychopathology showed minimal change. Importantly, there is no substantial increase in overall psychological distress, indicating that this person likely did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although the person started at T1 with pronounced risk factors (very high general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, high stress, and low social support), by T2 there were substantial improvements in key risk factors (large decreases in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, and substantial increases in life satisfaction). This pattern suggests recovery or ongoing disorder rather than new onset, so no new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 (very low self-efficacy, high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, and elevated psychopathology), there is no substantial increase in risk between T1 and T2—protective factors such as self-efficacy actually improve, and both anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations strongly decrease, suggesting the person did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite above-average stress and low positive mental health at T1, the individual displayed strong protective factors (high social support, increasing life satisfaction, rising self-efficacy, and decreasing general psychopathology by T2). There is no pattern indicating the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2, especially given improvements across most mental health indicators and reduced overall distress."
0,"Despite low baseline self-efficacy, high dysfunctional attitudes, and moderately elevated general psychopathology at T1 (suggesting ongoing difficulties), there is no marked increase in general psychopathology at T2, and several risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) actually decrease. The person starts out with significant challenges and likely a pre-existing disorder, but does not show evidence of developing a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although the individual has very low socioeconomic status and social support at T1 (risk factors), and there is a very large drop in positive mental health and a sharp increase in anxiety sensitivity between T1 and T2, protective changes are also present—notably, social support, general self-efficacy, and life satisfaction increase substantially, dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology both decrease, and fear of bodily sensations drops, strongly suggesting improved or stable mental health without new disorder onset."
0,"The person showed elevated psychological distress (GSI) and some dysfunctional attitudes at T1, suggesting the possibility of an ongoing psychological disorder; however, from T1 to T2, there is a marked reduction in general psychopathology (strong decline in GSI), stable or improving self-efficacy, and positive mental health, indicating recovery or stable mental health rather than the development of a new disorder."
0,"Although this individual started with multiple risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, along with low socioeconomic status and elevated BMI), the changes from T1 to T2 do not show a significant increase in general psychopathology or a marked decline in protective factors that would suggest the development of a new psychological disorder. Most risk factors, while present, remain relatively stable or increase only moderately, and the increase in GSI is negligible."
0,"Although the individual had initial risk factors such as low socioeconomic status and poor positive mental health at T1, their psychological state improved over time—protective factors like positive mental health and self-efficacy increased, while risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology decreased—indicating they did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some demographic risk factors (low education, BMI, and socioeconomic status) and moderately elevated stress and GSI at T1, the individual's protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, increasing social support, increasing positive mental health, and markedly decreased dysfunctional attitudes) outweighed risk; there was no substantial increase in general psychopathology, suggesting no new disorder developed."
0,"This individual started with strong protective factors at T1—including low psychopathology, low stress, strong life satisfaction, high social support, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low anxiety/fear—and while some risk factors did worsen (notably a moderate increase in general psychopathology and anxiety sensitivity), their overall psychological profile remains resilient, with increased positive mental health and self-efficacy. There is no clear indication of a new disorder developing, but rather some variability within generally healthy parameters."
1,"Although this person started with very high education and socioeconomic status, strong positive mental health, and low stress, there was a marked increase in risk factors between T1 and T2—including substantial rises in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology—despite increases in positive mental health and social support. The pattern of sharply elevated psychological distress and risk factors suggests the development of a new psychological disorder at T2."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1—high life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy, low stress, and low psychopathology—alongside elevated fear of bodily sensations, which decreased dramatically by T2. Positive mental health, self-efficacy, and social support all improved, and although GSI and life satisfaction worsened slightly, the overall risk profile remained low, indicating no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite low education (risk factor), the individual's baseline profile at T1 was not indicative of a psychological disorder, with low general psychopathology and below-average risk factors. Although there was a sharp drop in life satisfaction at T2, most risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, general psychopathology) actually decreased, and no substantial rise in clinical symptoms emerged, making the development of a new disorder unlikely."
0,"Despite multiple risk factors (low socioeconomic status and education, low positive mental health at T1, high anxiety sensitivity at T1, sharp increase in dysfunctional attitudes), the person showed strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, moderate self-efficacy, low stress, low GSI) and did not experience a large increase in general psychopathology (GSI increased only slightly and remains likely below clinical thresholds). There is no compelling evidence of new, clinically significant psychopathology developing between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite elevated risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), the individual shows increased protective factors between T1 and T2, such as marked gains in life satisfaction, positive mental health, and social support, with no significant increase in general psychopathology, indicating no new disorder developed."
0,"The individual started with robust protective factors at T1 (very high life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support, low stress, low anxiety sensitivity/fear of bodily sensations, and very low dysfunctional attitudes and GSI). Despite declining social support and life satisfaction at T2 and a small increase in GSI, risk factors remain low and there is no clear indication of new disorder development."
0,"The individual started with multiple protective factors (low stress, low psychopathology, very low dysfunctional attitudes, and low anxiety sensitivity/fear), and despite some increases in risk (notably GSI and anxiety measures at T2), there were also strong increases in life satisfaction and positive mental health, with ongoing low risk demographics. This pattern suggests some trend toward distress but not a clear emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite demographic risk factors (low education and SES, high BMI), the individual had strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, problem-focused coping, very low psychopathology and risk variables). While there was a large decrease in self-efficacy and a slight increase in psychopathology by T2, most protective factors remained strong or improved (e.g., social support and positive mental health increased), and risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) remained low, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
1,"The person had extremely poor protective factors at T1 (very low self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and severely low social support) combined with high risk factors (high dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and above-average stress). Between T1 and T2, there was a dramatic decline in positive mental health, a significant increase in fear of bodily sensations, and an increase in general psychopathology, all indicating substantial worsening and strong probability of new disorder onset."
0,"Despite very low protective factors and some risk factors at T1, all key psychological measures show marked improvements at T2 (large increases in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, along with a decrease in general psychopathology), indicating the person did not develop a psychological disorder but rather experienced significant recovery or strengthening of mental health."
1,"The individual was psychologically healthy at T1, with high positive mental health, good coping, low anxiety sensitivity/fear, and low stress, but between T1 and T2 there were sharp negative changes: drastic declines in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and especially life satisfaction, coupled with increases in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology—supporting the likelihood of new disorder development at T2."
0,"Although this individual experienced a marked decrease in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction) and a moderate increase in GSI (general psychopathology), their initial functioning was exceptionally robust, with high socioeconomic status and strong T1 resources suggesting substantial psychological resilience and no definitive indication of new disorder onset."
0,"Despite a challenging baseline at T1 with low social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, this individual showed significant improvements from T1 to T2 in social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, while general psychopathology decreased. These positive changes, along with stable to improving risk factors, indicate they did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although this individual had some baseline risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low life satisfaction, high stress, and low socioeconomic status), their protective factors (high social support, high self-efficacy, very low anxiety sensitivity and fear, and low GSI) were strong, and they did not exhibit increases in core risk variables or psychopathology between T1 and T2 (GSI decreased, positive mental health improved, and life satisfaction slightly increased), suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The individual had a generally healthy psychological profile at T1 with relatively high life satisfaction, low stress, and low psychopathology, and showed improvements or stability in most protective factors (increased positive mental health and social support, only slight decreases in life satisfaction and self-efficacy), and a slight decrease in general psychopathology; there is no evidence of significant deterioration or emergence of risk factors suggesting new disorder development."
0,"Despite very high psychological distress and multiple risk factors at T1 (low self-efficacy, very low social support and life satisfaction, high stress, high fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and elevated GSI), these difficulties appear ongoing rather than new onset, and between T1 and T2 there is marked improvement in protective factors (large increases in self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support) and a pronounced decrease in general psychopathology (GSI). Thus, there is no evidence of new disorder development; rather, the person shows substantial recovery."
0,"The person started with robust protective factors at T1 (very high positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction), despite high stress and anxiety sensitivity. By T2, their risk factors actually decreased significantly (notably a strong drop in anxiety sensitivity and GSI), while protective factors remained generally high; this pattern does not suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite extremely poor psychosocial functioning and high stress at T1 (very low social support and life satisfaction, high stress, low self-efficacy), all major protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) improved substantially between T1 and T2. Although there were increases in anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology, the large positive changes in key protective factors strongly indicate recovery or resilience rather than the new onset of a psychological disorder."
1,"Although the person had high positive mental health and low psychopathology at T1, the combination of low socioeconomic status, very high dysfunctional attitudes, decreased social support, increased fear of bodily sensations, increased general psychopathology, and a substantial decline in protective factors (like self-efficacy and social support), indicates a new onset of psychological disorder at T2."
0,"The individual started with mostly protective factors at T1 (low stress and psychopathology, moderate satisfaction, problem coping, low dysfunctional attitudes) and experienced a mixed pattern of changes, but did not show clear increases in core risk factors or general psychopathology; there is no substantial evidence for new disorder onset between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual had low education (risk factor), already reduced social support, high stress, moderate general psychopathology, and some coping deficits at T1, but was not meeting disorder criteria. Between T1 and T2, there were sharp declines in protective factors (self-efficacy, positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support), strong increases in dysfunctional attitudes, and a notable rise in overall psychopathology, all of which indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some ongoing risk factors at T1 (elevated GSI, low life satisfaction and self-efficacy, high fear of bodily sensations and dysfunctional attitudes), the individual shows improvements or stability on most key risk indicators between T1 and T2, such as a substantial decrease in general psychopathology and no marked increases in risk factors, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there is a marked decrease in positive mental health and life satisfaction and some worsening in social support, there is a strong protective trend in decreasing general psychopathology and anxiety sensitivity, improvement in general self-efficacy, and no strong increase in risk-related variables, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual already displayed significant risk factors and signs of psychological distress at T1 (notably very high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), suggesting a pre-existing psychological disorder. While some risk factors worsened (notably GSI), this does not reflect the **development of a new disorder** but rather a worsening of an ongoing condition."
0,"Although there is a notable increase in general psychopathology from T1 to T2 and a strong drop in social support, key risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations decrease markedly, and positive mental health actually improves; baseline protective factors like self-efficacy were quite strong, so despite some increases in risk and loss of some protective factors, the overall pattern is not consistent with the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite elevated baseline risk (high dysfunctional attitudes, low social support, low self-efficacy, high GSI at T1), there is substantial improvement in positive mental health at T2, decreased fear of bodily sensations, and no meaningful spike in key risk factors or general psychopathology; thus, the observed pattern does not support the development of a new disorder."
0,"The person started with generally strong protective factors at T1 (high life satisfaction, self-efficacy, coping skills, social support, very low stress and psychopathology, low anxiety sensitivity and fear), and while general psychopathology increased at T2, positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction also improved, and dysfunctional attitudes actually decreased. The pattern suggests increased psychological distress but not the clear development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had low risk at T1 (very low GSI, below-average psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, low anxiety sensitivity and fear, and high self-efficacy), and although GSI increased moderately at T2, there were improvements in protective factors like positive mental health and life satisfaction, and a substantial reduction in dysfunctional attitudes—collectively suggesting no new disorder development."
0,"Despite increased risk markers (notably anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations) and a moderate rise in general psychopathology from T1 to T2, this person started with high protective factors (self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, low dysfunctional attitudes, good coping skills, negative GSI) and showed further gains in positive mental health and life satisfaction, which likely buffered against developing a new psychological disorder."
1,"The person had high initial risk factors at T1 (elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), some protective factors (high positive mental health, below average stress), but extremely low self-efficacy and life satisfaction. Critically, between T1 and T2, their positive mental health dropped sharply, their GSI (general psychopathology) increased substantially, and while self-efficacy and life satisfaction improved, these gains were not sufficient to offset the overall weakening of protective factors and a marked increase in psychological distress, indicating the likely development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with a psychologically healthy profile at T1 (low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, high self-efficacy, and low risk factor scores), and while some risk factors (such as fear and anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology) slightly increased at T2, protective factors like life satisfaction and positive mental health also substantially improved. The overall pattern suggests improvement and resilience rather than the onset of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The person began T1 with exceptionally high positive mental health, life satisfaction, and adequate social support, but experienced dramatic reductions in all major protective factors and a large increase in general psychopathology by T2, suggesting the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although the person experienced substantial decreases in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, as well as increases in some risk factors, they started with clear above-average psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, and stress at T1 (already at-risk or with possible disorder). Notably, their general psychopathology (GSI) score decreased markedly by T2, suggesting not the onset but rather improvement or ongoing struggle without a new disorder developing."
0,"Despite some demographic risk (low SES) and a substantial drop in self-efficacy and life satisfaction, the person began with remarkably robust protective factors (very high self-efficacy and life satisfaction, very low psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes), and most changes over time (e.g., increased positive mental health, decreased fear of bodily sensations and dysfunctional attitudes) suggest maintained resilience; the moderate rise in GSI and anxiety sensitivity remains insufficient in magnitude against this strong baseline, making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"The person already exhibited strong risk factors and marked psychopathology at T1, with elevated GSI, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and low protective factors, indicating an existing psychological disorder; thus, there is no evidence of a new disorder developing between T1 and T2."
1,"Although the individual started with strong protective factors like high socioeconomic status, low stress, and high life satisfaction at T1, their already high dysfunctional attitudes increased substantially by T2, general psychopathology also increased, and social support remained very low. These changes, especially in dysfunctional attitudes and GSI, suggest the development of a psychological disorder by T2."
0,"The individual displayed several protective factors at T1 (high social support, self-efficacy, and low stress), with only mild risk markers (low positive mental health, some dysfunctional attitudes, moderate anxiety sensitivity). From T1 to T2, most risk variables decreased or remained stable, and protective factors generally improved (notably higher life satisfaction and positive mental health, lower anxiety sensitivity, and lower general psychopathology), making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
1,"The individual was psychologically healthy at T1 but developed increased risk factors and worsening indicators at T2, notably strong increases in anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, reductions in protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy), and a rise in general psychopathology, all consistent with the likely development of a psychological disorder."
1,"Although the individual showed high protective factors and low risk at T1, there were extremely large declines in social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, accompanied by a marked increase in dysfunctional attitudes; this dramatic loss of protective factors and increase in risk factors strongly suggests the onset of a psychological disorder at T2."
1,"The individual began with very strong protective factors at T1 (low psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, low anxiety sensitivity/fear, high life satisfaction, social support, and self-efficacy), but over time saw marked increases in risk factors: a large increase in general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, and fear/anxiety sensitivity, along with a dramatic drop in life satisfaction. This pattern suggests the development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite significant increases in stress and emotion-focused coping at T1, the individual had high protective factors at baseline (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low GSI). Although there was a marked decline in positive mental health and life satisfaction and increased general psychopathology by T2, these changes are not of a magnitude and pattern to indicate a clear transition from healthy to disorder onset, and key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) remained stable or decreased."
0,"Despite very poor social support and dysfunctional attitudes at T1, the individual started with high positive mental health, low stress, low psychopathology, and improved substantially in key protective factors from T1 to T2 (notably life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and social support) alongside reductions in risk factors (fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes), suggesting no new psychological disorder developed. The slight increase in GSI is modest and does not outweigh the overall positive changes and strong initial protective profile."
0,"The individual starts with substantial protective factors (high socioeconomic status, strong social support, good self-efficacy, low stress, low psychopathology, and low dysfunctional attitudes) and, while some risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity) increase and some protective variables decline slightly, positive mental health increases markedly and general psychopathology remains low; this pattern does not support the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a sharp increase in dysfunctional attitudes, this individual maintains strong protective factors: high T1 social support and self-efficacy, low stress, low initial psychopathology, and marked increases in life satisfaction and self-efficacy over time; GSI actually decreases, suggesting no new disorder development."
0,"Despite having lower education and high BMI as potential risk factors, the individual displayed generally good baseline mental health at T1 (low stress, low psychopathology, high self-efficacy, and low dysfunctional attitudes), and most key risk factors actually improved or remained stable from T1 to T2 (increased social support, life satisfaction, reduced anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations). There is no substantial increase in general psychopathology or other risk markers, so no new psychological disorder development is indicated."
0,"Although T1 shows high risk for psychological disorders (very high GSI, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, high stress, and high dysfunctional attitudes), these are ongoing rather than new, and T1-to-T2 changes show improvement in general psychopathology (GSI decreases), no major new risk factors emerge, and no evidence suggests the development of a new disorder—rather, the person continues to experience difficulties present at T1."
0,"Despite significant risk factors at T1 (high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), there are strong protective demographics and meaningful improvements between T1 and T2—including reductions in general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, and distress—indicating that the individual did not develop a new psychological disorder and likely experienced recovery or remission instead."
0,"Despite a moderate decrease in positive mental health, initial functioning was relatively healthy, and there were substantial increases in protective factors such as life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and stable social support, with only minor increases in some risk factors and general psychopathology remaining low; therefore, there is insufficient evidence for new disorder development."
0,"Although this person had significant risk factors at T1 (low education, low socioeconomic status, poor life satisfaction, low positive mental health, and high initial psychopathology), the very large decrease in general psychopathology (GSI), combined with increased self-efficacy and stable-to-slightly improved protective factors, suggests recovery or ongoing disorder rather than the development of any new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite the dramatic decline in positive mental health and life satisfaction at T2, the person started with strong positive mental health and moderate self-efficacy, and experienced improved general self-efficacy and reduced psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes over time; these shifts indicate overall improved resilience and reduced risk, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Although some protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support) decreased and dysfunctional attitudes increased, initial high protective factors and low general psychopathology at both T1 and T2 (with no notable GSI increase) suggest no development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there are decreases in some protective factors (e.g., self-efficacy, social support) and increases in select risk factors (fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes), the person was not experiencing significant psychopathology at T1, and their general psychopathology (GSI) actually decreased at T2. There is no clear pattern indicating the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this person has some demographic risk factors (lower BMI, lower socioeconomic status) and low initial self-efficacy with high dysfunctional attitudes and very high general psychopathology at T1, their GSI drops dramatically by T2, and most risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity) do not increase meaningfully; instead, there is improvement in self-efficacy and life satisfaction. No indication of new disorder onset is present—rather, the data suggest recovery or sustained disorder, not new onset."
0,"Despite low protective factors and elevated risk factors at T1 (especially high anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes), this person actually improved between T1 and T2: general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, and life satisfaction all significantly decreased, while positive mental health and social support increased—suggesting recovery or resilience rather than the development of a new disorder."
0,"Although the person demonstrates several risk factors at T1—low education, low positive mental health, low social support, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, high stress, and high dysfunctional attitudes—overall psychopathology remains low at baseline, and changes over time are moderate: most psychological variables change only slightly, and GSI only increases slightly but does not suggest a clinical threshold was crossed. Thus, there is no compelling evidence of new disorder onset between T1 and T2."
0,"The person starts with some minor risk factors (low positive mental health, low social support, slightly elevated stress and dysfunctional attitudes), but has strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, decent life satisfaction, low psychopathology at T1). From T1 to T2, risk factors do not worsen, most relevant variables (life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support, GSI, dysfunctional attitudes) actually improve or decline only moderately, and there’s no substantial increase in psychopathology—suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite decreases in positive mental health and self-efficacy and increases in some risk factors (fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes), the marked reduction in general psychopathology (GSI) between T1 and T2, combined with already elevated distress and low dysfunctional attitudes at T1, indicate recovery rather than the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual exhibited several strong protective factors at T1—including high education, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and problem-focused coping, alongside low general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes—and these remained stable or improved slightly by T2. Despite an increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, T1 baseline risk was very low; overall, there is no clear indication of new disorder onset, as the protective profile remains robust and no major decline in central mental health variables is evident."
0,"Despite starting with multiple risk factors at T1 (below-average socioeconomic status, education, BMI, and several indicators of low positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction), the individual shows improvement in protective factors from T1 to T2 (increases in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction), and general psychopathology (GSI) actually decreases, indicating reduced distress. Although dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity increase, the overall improvement and lack of significant escalation in psychological distress suggest no new disorder development."
0,"The individual began with exceptionally strong protective factors (very high positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; low stress and psychopathology) and, despite substantial declines across multiple areas by T2, their risk factors (such as general psychopathology) did not increase and even decreased, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"The person started with notable protective factors at T1 (high life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support, low stress, low psychopathology, and low dysfunctional attitudes), and while there is some increase in anxiety sensitivity and a slight decrease in positive mental health, key risk factors decrease (notably dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology), while self-efficacy increases substantially; thus, there is no compelling evidence of new disorder onset."
0,"Although there were some increases in risk factors (such as anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology) between T1 and T2, the person started with relatively low risk (very low stress, low GSI, low anxiety sensitivity, moderately high life satisfaction), and showed improvement in positive mental health and self-efficacy. The changes do not rise to the magnitude or pattern indicative of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual already exhibited a high level of general psychopathology (GSI), low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, and low life satisfaction at T1, indicating the likely presence of a psychological disorder or significant distress at baseline. Substantial improvements from T1 to T2—such as decreased psychopathology (large drop in GSI), increased self-efficacy and life satisfaction, and increased protective factors—suggest recovery or ongoing difficulties rather than the new onset of a disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and a small increase in some risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, GSI), this person started with a low-risk profile at T1 (low stress, low psychopathology, high social support, low dysfunctional attitudes), and the observed changes do not indicate sufficient deterioration to support the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this person had multiple risk factors at T1 (low education, low positive mental health, low social support, very low life satisfaction, and high stress), their protective factors (self-efficacy and coping) were intact, and T1 GSI was low; improvements in positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction, and stable or decreased risk factors at T2 suggest no new disorder developed, even though GSI increased, as their baseline was already subclinical."
0,"Although there was a sharp drop in positive mental health and self-efficacy between T1 and T2, the individual already exhibited elevated general psychopathology at T1, indicating ongoing psychological difficulties rather than the development of a new disorder. The decline in some protective factors is notable, but does not constitute the onset of a new psychological disorder given the high risk and likely disorder present at T1."
0,"The individual starts with very low risk factors (low psychopathology, low stress, high self-efficacy, low anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes), and even though socioeconomic status is low (risk) and positive mental health slightly decreases, their protective factors (life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy) increase from T1 to T2 and there is no large increase in risk factors or psychopathology, suggesting no development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors (high social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and low psychopathology and anxiety measures) and, while some risk factors increased moderately (such as general psychopathology), substantial improvements in positive mental health and key protective factors suggest no clear development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person already showed significant psychological distress and dysfunction at T1 (high GSI, high stress, strongly dysfunctional attitudes), along with multiple demographic risk factors, suggesting an existing disorder rather than new onset. Although several protective factors decline sharply, there is no evidence here for the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2—the case appears to be chronic or ongoing rather than incident."
1,"The individual started out with moderate protective factors (good self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support) and only mild risk factors at T1, but exhibited substantial increases in general psychopathology (GSI) and substantial decreases in life satisfaction and social support by T2, indicating a significant decline in mental health suggestive of new disorder development."
0,"Although this individual had significant risk factors at T1, including low protective factors and high psychopathology (likely indicating a pre-existing disorder), they showed substantial improvement in self-efficacy, reduced general psychopathology, and increased social support by T2; there is no evidence for the development of a new disorder—if anything, their mental health appears to have improved."
0,"The individual had moderate risk factors at T1, including elevated dysfunctional attitudes and psychopathology, but at T2, general psychopathology decreased substantially and several protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) increased or remained stable, indicating no new psychological disorder was developed."
1,"Despite relatively high social support and life satisfaction at T1, the individual starts with below-average positive mental health and has significant increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and some rise in psychopathology between T1 and T2—this pattern indicates the likely development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there is a large decline in positive mental health and self-efficacy as well as increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, the person starts with very high positive mental health and self-efficacy, only mild initial psychopathology, and ends up with a decreased, but not elevated, general psychopathology at T2. Furthermore, the GSI actually decreases between T1 and T2, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite high baseline risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low social support, low self-efficacy, elevated anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes), the individual showed substantial improvements in positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction, and large reductions in anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology between T1 and T2, suggesting recovery or resilience rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual started with numerous risk factors at T1 (low socioeconomic status, low social support, poor self-efficacy, elevated stress, high psychopathology), T2 is characterized by substantial increases in protective factors (positive mental health and self-efficacy) and reduced general psychopathology, suggesting recovery or significant improvement rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual shows some risk factors at T1 (very low social support, high dysfunctional attitudes, high GSI indicating ongoing psychological distress), there is strong evidence for substantial recovery by T2—a large decrease in GSI (general psychopathology), slight reductions in maladaptive traits, and stable or improved factors such as life satisfaction. There is no indication of a new disorder developing; instead, the data suggest ongoing or recovering psychopathology."
0,"Despite very low baseline protective factors (notably social support and life satisfaction), there is a clear improvement in most variables from T1 to T2—social support increases sharply, psychopathology (GSI) decreases, and there are no major increases in risk factors—suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Although this individual had protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, positive mental health, and low psychological distress), the significant increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and fear of bodily sensations by T2—combined with already low socioeconomic status and drops in self-efficacy and social support—suggest the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with strong protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and coping), and while positive mental health decreased markedly at T2, there was no significant increase in risk factors or general psychopathology—in fact, overall psychological distress decreased considerably—indicating no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite increased risk factors such as rises in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology from T1 to T2, the extremely large positive change in positive mental health and general self-efficacy indicates strengthened protective factors. Given these substantial improvements and an already relatively low baseline GSI (general psychopathology), it is unlikely that this individual developed a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started with above-average protective factors (high life satisfaction, social support, low stress, low dysfunctional attitudes) and despite notable decreases in positive mental health, life satisfaction, and social support, their general psychopathology actually decreased and dysfunctional attitudes—although sharply increased—remained only one aspect among otherwise stable or improved risk factors. The overall pattern does not indicate the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this individual started with some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, high stress, elevated anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations), their condition improved at T2, with increases in protective factors like positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, and a marked decrease in general psychopathology. There is no indication of new psychological disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"Although this person has lower education and socioeconomic status (risk factors), their initial mental health status was overall healthy with low distress, good self-efficacy, and only mildly elevated dysfunctional attitudes. Between T1 and T2, while positive mental health and self-efficacy decreased and general psychopathology slightly increased, anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes also decreased, and there is no strong evidence for the emergence of new severe psychopathology—suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Although this individual had significant psychological risk factors at T1 (high stress, low self-efficacy, low social support and life satisfaction, elevated anxiety sensitivity and psychopathology), their situation improved or stabilized over time: positive mental health and life satisfaction increased, dysfunctional attitudes barely changed, and general psychopathology remained essentially stable. There is no evidence to suggest new onset of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2, as key protective factors improved and risk factors did not markedly worsen."
0,"Despite marked increases in some risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes), the person was already experiencing significantly elevated baseline risk (extremely low social support, very low self-efficacy, above-average general psychopathology) at T1, suggesting possible ongoing psychological difficulties rather than the emergence of a new disorder between T1 and T2. The observed worsening likely represents a continuation or exacerbation of existing issues, not the development of a new disorder."
0,"Although the individual started with moderately elevated risk (low positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; high stress and fear of bodily sensations; above-average GSI), there were significant protective changes by T2, including strong increases in positive mental health and social support, moderate increases in life satisfaction, and only small increases in risk factors. The substantial increases in protective factors suggest recovery or resilience rather than new disorder development."
1,"The individual had relatively low positive mental health and life satisfaction but high coping resources and social support at T1, with minimal psychological distress and strong protective factors (low dysfunctional attitudes, low stress). By T2, there is a very large increase in positive mental health, but also a drastic increase in general psychopathology (GSI), which suggests the emergence of significant psychological symptoms; this, combined with a large increase in fear of bodily sensations, indicates the development of a psychological disorder despite some improved perceptions of well-being."
1,"The individual was psychologically healthy at T1, but between T1 and T2 showed very large increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology (GSI), all of which are strong risk indicators for new disorder development, despite improvements in protective factors such as positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction."
0,"Despite a marked drop in positive mental health, the person began with strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, positive mental health, very low anxiety/fear, and low dysfunctional attitudes), and GSI indicates no increase in psychopathology—in fact, it decreased—suggesting no new disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started with generally strong protective factors at T1, such as above-average social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, despite elevated stress and slightly lowered positive mental health; from T1 to T2, there were no major increases in risk factors or GSI, and most changes (e.g., reductions in general psychopathology, decreases in anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, and stable or improved social support) suggest a reduced or stable risk of developing a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status, education, and BMI (risk factors), the individual shows improvements in key protective factors between T1 and T2, such as increased self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction, as well as a substantial decrease in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, indicating a reduced risk of developing a psychological disorder."
0,"Although the person starts with some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, high stress, high anxiety sensitivity) and shows a notable increase in general psychopathology at T2, there are also substantial increases in protective factors such as general self-efficacy and life satisfaction. Since there is no strong evidence of developing a new disorder (given already elevated risk at T1 and increases in resilience factors), it is unlikely that a new psychological disorder emerged between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite initial risk factors (low socioeconomic status, low education, low positive mental health, low social support, and low life satisfaction at T1), there are strong protective trends from T1 to T2: substantial increases in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, and only a moderate rise in psychopathology (GSI) which likely reflects improved overall functioning; accordingly, the profile does not suggest new disorder development."
0,"Although the person started at T1 with lower socioeconomic status and low positive mental health and self-efficacy, their T1 risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, general psychopathology) were well below average and protective factors improved over time (increases in positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, plus a decrease in general psychopathology). This pattern indicates a reduced risk and no evidence for new psychological disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual had strong protective factors at T1, including high education, socioeconomic status, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and coping skills, with low initial psychopathology. Despite a moderate increase in distress (GSI) at T2 and some losses in life satisfaction and social support, key risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and fear of bodily sensations decreased, and positive mental health improved—making it unlikely they developed a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status, the individual began with strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, very high life satisfaction, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes), and most psychological variables either remained stable or improved by T2, with only a moderate increase in risk (dysfunctional attitudes). General psychopathology remained well below average, no critical rise in distress or risk factors occurred, so there is no clear indication of new disorder development."
0,"The individual exhibited high general psychopathology at T1 (already above the clinical threshold), meaning they likely already had a psychological disorder at baseline; by T2, psychopathology dramatically decreased, while protective factors (self-efficacy, positive mental health, life satisfaction) improved, making the development of a new disorder highly unlikely."
0,"Although the individual has low socioeconomic status, education, and BMI (demographic risk factors), their T1 psychological profile is strong, with high positive mental health, self-efficacy, low stress, and good coping skills (protective factors). While there is a significant drop in positive mental health between T1 and T2, other risk factors such as dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology actually decrease or remain stable, and there is no increase in general psychopathology, suggesting that a new psychological disorder did not develop."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and high baseline stress, the person started with strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, positive mental health, social support, very low dysfunctional attitudes) and improved substantially in positive mental health and life satisfaction from T1 to T2; although general psychopathology (GSI) increased moderately, the overall profile suggests resilience and not the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual already showed above-average general psychopathology and some risk factors at T1 (elevated GSI, stress, anxiety sensitivity, low self-efficacy), but over time most risk factors improved: general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes all decreased, while positive mental health and self-efficacy increased. This pattern suggests ongoing difficulties rather than the development of a new disorder, so there is no evidence for a new psychological disorder emerging between T1 and T2."
0,"Although the person showed a significant increase in dysfunctional attitudes and a sharp drop in self-efficacy, their baseline mental health was exceptionally strong (high self-efficacy, low stress and psychopathology, high life satisfaction, and very low dysfunctional attitudes), and changes in risk factors like GSI and anxiety sensitivity were only marginal. The overall protective factors and stability in general psychopathology suggest they did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual was psychologically healthy at T1, with multiple protective factors (strong self-efficacy, low stress, low anxiety sensitivity, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low general psychopathology). By T2, however, there were substantial increases in risk factors—marked rises in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, alongside a dramatic loss in self-efficacy and social support—strongly indicating the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual displays strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, social support, socioeconomic status, low stress, low psychopathology, and low dysfunctional attitudes), and despite some decrease in protective factors and a mild increase in general psychopathology at T2, their overall risk profile remains low with no signs of the onset of a new disorder."
0,"Despite a dramatic decline in positive mental health and ongoing low social support, the individual started with high protective factors (very high positive mental health, high general self-efficacy, low stress) and although some risk factors were present at T1 (high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), these actually decreased between T1 and T2. General psychopathology only increased slightly and remained below the threshold suggestive of a disorder, making new disorder onset unlikely."
1,"Although the person started with several protective factors such as high education, high positive mental health, and good social support, there are dramatic increases in risk factors between T1 and T2—especially large increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, along with sharp drops in positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction. This strong shift toward risk, coupled with declining protective factors, suggests the development of a psychological disorder at T2."
0,"Although this individual had significant psychological difficulties at T1 (very high general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, extremely low self-efficacy and social support), these difficulties were already present at baseline and markedly improved by T2 (large decreases in GSI and dysfunctional attitudes, and substantial increases in self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction). Thus, there is no evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite a strong increase in anxiety sensitivity and a significant decline in general self-efficacy, key protective factors such as life satisfaction, positive mental health, and social support all increased from T1 to T2, and general psychopathology remained low and stable, indicating no new disorder development."
0,"Although the individual displayed several risk factors at T1 (high stress, low problem-focused coping, high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, and above-average psychopathology), their mental health measures improved or remained stable between T1 and T2 (notably, increases in self-efficacy and life satisfaction, and large decreases in anxiety sensitivity and fear). There is no indication of increased general psychopathology or new risk factor emergence, so a new psychological disorder is unlikely."
0,"Despite several demographic risk factors (lower education and socioeconomic status) and initially low positive mental health at T1, the individual shows substantial improvements in protective factors between T1 and T2 (notably, large increases in positive mental health and social support). There are decreases in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, with only a minor increase in general psychopathology, which remains below average; as such, the pattern does not suggest development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this person faces demographic risk factors (lower education and socioeconomic status) and sees a notable drop in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction), their baseline at T1 was psychologically healthy (low GSI, high life satisfaction, social support, low stress). The modest increase in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations) and GSI is not of sufficient magnitude or abruptness to indicate the onset of a new psychological disorder at T2."
0,"Despite significant risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low social support, high stress, low life satisfaction, and above-average psychological distress), the individual's protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) dramatically improved from T1 to T2, while general psychopathology did not increase—suggesting recovery or improvement rather than the onset of a new disorder."
0,"The individual starts with strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, positive mental health, life satisfaction, and social support; low dysfunctional attitudes and psychopathology), and most risk factors either decrease or remain stable from T1 to T2. There is no indication of a marked increase in risk or worsening of psychopathology, so it is unlikely a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite low education and significant psychological distress at T1 (including high stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology), the person shows very large improvements in protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction) and substantial decreases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes, general psychopathology) by T2. This pattern suggests recovery rather than the development of a new disorder."
1,"The person was psychologically healthy at T1 with high levels of protective factors and low risk factors, but experienced a substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI), a large loss in self-efficacy, increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes by T2, strongly suggesting the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, social support, low stress, extremely low dysfunctional attitudes and psychopathology), and although there was a significant increase in general psychopathology and a large drop in life satisfaction between T1 and T2, risk variables (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations) remained low and changes were mild; the overall pattern does not suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Although the individual showed moderate positive mental health and social support at T1, their low self-efficacy and life satisfaction combined with very high stress were risk factors. Between T1 and T2, there were substantial increases in general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations, coupled with a marked drop in positive mental health—clear indicators that a psychological disorder likely developed."
0,"The person exhibited low levels of psychological distress and strong protective factors (low dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations) at T1, and although some risk factors (GSI and dysfunctional attitudes) increased at T2, overall mental health, self-efficacy, and risk-related variables improved or remained within a healthy range, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Despite some increases in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology, the individual showed improvements in protective factors such as positive mental health, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy, while baseline risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, general psychopathology) remained low. There is no clear evidence of transition from psychological health to disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started with some below-average positive mental health and high socioeconomic status, but had mostly protective factors (such as high social support, low anxiety sensitivity, low fear of bodily sensations, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low GSI at T1). Changes from T1 to T2 show improvements in positive mental health, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, with only modest increases in risk factors and GSI remaining near average, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual was psychologically healthy at T1 with strong protective factors (high life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy, very low stress, low risk factor scores); although there were small increases in general psychopathology and decreases in some positive indicators by T2, there were also further reductions in nearly all core risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations), and no meaningful emergence of new risk. The overall pattern suggests maintained mental health, not the development of a new disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status, education, and self-efficacy (risk factors), the individual showed improvement in life satisfaction and a substantial decrease in general psychopathology from T1 to T2, with no marked increase in core risk factors; this pattern does not support the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had relatively low risk at T1, with low general psychopathology, low anxiety sensitivity, and very low dysfunctional attitudes, despite low positive mental health and coping. Although anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes increased somewhat by T2, protective factors (life satisfaction and social support) also improved, and overall psychopathology remained low, indicating no clear development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person had a strong profile of protective factors at T1 (very high self-efficacy, high life satisfaction, low psychopathology, very low dysfunctional attitudes, low stress and anxiety sensitivity), and although there are some increases in risk factors (notably GSI and sensitivity/fear), overall positive mental health and social support increased, while the end levels of risk factors likely remain below critical thresholds for disorder development within this time frame."
0,"Despite socioeconomic and education-related risk factors and low T1 positive mental health and self-efficacy, this individual shows substantial improvements in key protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction) from T1 to T2. There is no marked increase in general psychopathology (GSI), and initial risk factors are mitigated by these strong positive changes, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"The individual already exhibited significant psychopathology at T1 (high GSI, high anxiety sensitivity, high fear of bodily sensations), so any ongoing or mildly worsening symptoms reflect continuation of previous difficulties rather than development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some demographic risk (low BMI and low socioeconomic status) and average/below-average baseline mental health, key risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology all decreased over time, and social support and life satisfaction improved, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite a sharp decline in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, the person had already elevated general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes at T1, suggesting pre-existing vulnerability. However, the changes from T1 to T2 actually indicate a decrease in risk factors—general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes both substantially decreased—and substantial risk factors (e.g., GSI) did not newly increase, making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"Although there were some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, elevated dysfunctional attitudes, high anxiety sensitivity), overall psychopathology was only slightly elevated, and by T2 most risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) strongly decreased, while psychopathology remained nearly unchanged; there is no evidence for new disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite the initial presence of risk factors at T1 (low socioeconomic status, low positive mental health, self-efficacy, and social support; high anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes), the individual showed substantial improvements in protective factors (increased positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy) and reductions in risk factors (large decreases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology) by T2, which indicates recovery or increasing resilience rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1 (high education, socioeconomic status, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; low stress and dysfunctional attitudes; low general psychopathology) and showed positive changes between T1 and T2 in mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with additional reductions in several risk factors. While there was a slight increase in general psychopathology, it was not substantial enough to outweigh the considerable improvements in key protective factors, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Although this person started with some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, elevated GSI), they also had some protective factors (high life satisfaction, self-efficacy, low dysfunctional attitudes). By T2, most variables improved or stayed stable—positive mental health and life satisfaction increased, and both fear of bodily sensations and dysfunctional attitudes decreased or remained low—despite a notable increase in general psychopathology (GSI), the pattern does not indicate the clear onset of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite a low socioeconomic status (risk factor), this individual had strong protective factors at T1—high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and low psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes. While T2 shows decreases in protective factors and a mild increase in risk factors and general psychopathology, the overall magnitude of pathological change remains moderate and does not support clear onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this person had some diminished protective factors at T1 (below-average positive mental health and life satisfaction, low coping), their risk factors (e.g., general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations) were low and remained stable or improved between T1 and T2. Despite a mild increase in general psychopathology at T2, there are also improvements in social support and life satisfaction, and no strong emergence of risk factors, making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"Although there were significant risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low life satisfaction, high stress, high anxiety/fear, high GSI), the person’s mental health substantially improved between T1 and T2, with marked decreases in psychopathology, anxiety, fear, and dysfunctional attitudes, and large increases in protective factors like self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction, indicating recovery or significant improvement rather than the development of a new disorder."
1,"The person starts with strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support, coping, and low psychopathology) but experiences marked declines in these areas (notably self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support) and a large increase in general psychopathology, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes between T1 and T2, indicating new onset of psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low education (a risk factor), at T1 there are protective factors such as above-average positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, with only mild elevated general psychopathology. From T1 to T2, there are strong decreases in some protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy), but large decreases in key risk factors—anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations—suggest reduced risk, and overall psychopathology is virtually unchanged, indicating no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there are increases in some risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI), the individual started with relatively low baseline risk (low psychopathology, good life satisfaction, and low stress), and showed improvements in key protective factors (positive mental health, social support, general self-efficacy). The pattern indicates some increased vulnerability but does not clearly suggest the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"This person started with some elevated risk factors (lower positive mental health, higher stress, reduced coping, slightly elevated dysfunctional attitudes and fear of bodily sensations), but also strong protective factors (good social support, high life satisfaction, low psychopathology) and showed no dramatic negative shifts; while there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology and a decrease in social support, overall baseline health and some protective developments (self-efficacy increased, dysfunctional attitudes decreased) suggest no new psychological disorder likely developed."
0,"The person started with some vulnerability (low positive mental health, low socioeconomic status), but demonstrated strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, life satisfaction, general self-efficacy, and very low dysfunctional attitudes), and most psychological risk factors remained low or even improved slightly between T1 and T2; thus, there is no clear evidence of a new psychological disorder developing."
1,"Although the individual started with some protective factors at T1 (low dysfunctional attitudes, low general psychopathology, above-average social support, effective problem-focused coping, and low stress), their already low positive mental health and self-efficacy combined with a sharp increase in key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), along with large decreases in life satisfaction and social support by T2, indicate a significant elevation in risk and the likely development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual began with strong protective factors—high life satisfaction, low stress, high self-efficacy, and very low dysfunctional attitudes and psychopathology—which mostly remained within healthy ranges despite some reductions and minor increases in risk markers. Although life satisfaction and self-efficacy dipped and dysfunctional attitudes rose, their levels likely stayed non-clinical, with no substantial rise in general psychopathology, indicating no new disorder developed."
0,"Despite some demographic risk (lower education and BMI), the individual began with strong protective factors (high positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction, low stress and general psychopathology) and showed declines in positive mental health and life satisfaction but also improvements in risk factors (lower anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes, and psychopathology) between T1 and T2, indicating no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The person started with high positive mental health and social support, despite low self-efficacy and life satisfaction, and a mix of risk (high fear of bodily sensations, low coping) and protective factors. From T1 to T2, their positive mental health significantly declined, but general self-efficacy and life satisfaction improved, and key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI) decreased, suggesting overall reduced risk and no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite very high general psychopathology at T1, indicating the presence of an existing psychological disorder, there is a large decrease in psychopathology between T1 and T2 alongside decreases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations) and an increase in dysfunctional attitudes; the data suggest recovery or ongoing disorder rather than the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite high initial risk at T1 (very low life satisfaction, high stress, high GSI, and reduced self-efficacy), the individual exhibited a large improvement in general psychopathology and a marked reduction in anxiety sensitivity by T2. Although several protective factors worsened, the significant reduction in overall psychological distress suggests recovery, not the development of a new disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and some initial risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, life satisfaction, and high anxiety sensitivity), this person exhibited strong improvements in most protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction) and substantial decreases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) from T1 to T2; the moderate increase in GSI does not outweigh these improvements, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Despite a strong decrease in positive mental health and an increase in dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity, the individual’s general psychopathology actually decreased substantially, while life satisfaction and self-efficacy improved; overall, there is no evidence of new disorder development given improving psychological distress and strong protective factors at both points."
1,"Although there are some improvements in protective factors (notably large increases in positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction at T2), the person started with very low life satisfaction, negative social support, and high stress at T1. Most importantly, there is a dramatic increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2 (+3.60 SD), strongly suggesting the development of a psychological disorder, supported by increased anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes."
0,"The individual had a psychologically healthy baseline at T1, with high protective factors (high self-efficacy, social support, positive mental health, low psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes). While some risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI) increased at T2, all key protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) also increased substantially, making the overall profile unlikely to support the onset of a new disorder."
0,"Despite some demographic risk from lower education and a low baseline of positive mental health, the individual's T1 protective factors include high self-efficacy, low dysfunctional attitudes, and very low psychopathology. Most notably, from T1 to T2, there are strong improvements in life satisfaction, social support, and self-efficacy with only minor increases in GSI and a drop in positive mental health, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Although this individual had high psychological distress at T1 and some risk factors (low education/BMI, low self-efficacy, high stress, high GSI), there was already evidence of a psychological disorder at T1 rather than new onset at T2; changes between T1 and T2 do not indicate significant new increases in pathology or risk, and in fact, several protective factors (positive mental health, social support) increased from T1 to T2."
0,"The person began with moderately low positive mental health and social support but generally low psychopathology and risk, with several protective factors (e.g., good self-efficacy, coping, life satisfaction, low stress). Between T1 and T2, no risk factors substantially increased and several (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations) strongly decreased, with only minor increases in general psychopathology and small reductions in some protective factors—suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite significant demographic risk factors (low education, BMI, and socioeconomic status) and some increases in risk factors like GSI and anxiety sensitivity, the person started T1 without a psychological disorder (low GSI), and many other risk factors (e.g., dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations) decreased over time; protective factors such as social support increased. There is no strong evidence of a new disorder emerging between T1 and T2."
0,"The person started with average mental health, high social support and self-efficacy, but low life satisfaction and somewhat elevated risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and mild general psychopathology). By T2, key risk factors like anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology all showed substantial decreases, and life satisfaction improved markedly, together presenting a pattern of psychological improvement rather than new disorder development."
0,"Although the individual started with notable risk factors at T1 (low education, high general psychopathology, low social support and self-efficacy, elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), these factors mostly improved or remained stable from T1 to T2: general psychopathology decreased, positive mental health increased markedly, and anxiety sensitivity dropped. There are no signs of new disorder onset; rather, there are indicating improvements or stabilization in key risk domains."
0,"The individual started with low baseline risk (low psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and strong social support/self-efficacy). Despite a decrease in positive mental health, most risk factors stayed low or further decreased (notably anxiety sensitivity), key protective factors improved (life satisfaction, social support), and there was no increase in general psychopathology, making a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2 unlikely."
0,"The person began with generally strong protective factors (low stress, high life satisfaction, negative dysfunctional attitudes, below-average general psychopathology) and showed further improvements in protective variables (increased social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy), with no significant rises in key risk factors or psychopathology; therefore, there is no evidence to suggest development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite a low baseline in protective factors (self-efficacy, social support, positive mental health), there is no substantial increase in major risk factors and, crucially, general psychopathology decreases between T1 and T2. Although anxiety sensitivity rises and life satisfaction drops, protective factors like positive mental health and self-efficacy slightly improve, and general psychological symptoms decline, indicating the person did not develop a new psychological disorder."
1,"Although the person had some protective factors at T1, such as good social support, self-efficacy, and low dysfunctional attitudes or anxiety sensitivity, T2 brought major increases in risk factors: notably, a large rise in general psychopathology (GSI), dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and a significant loss of social support. This sharp deterioration points to the development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some initial T1 risk factors (low positive mental health, high anxiety sensitivity, high fear of bodily sensations), T1 also shows strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, low general psychopathology). Between T1 and T2, there is a dramatic loss in social support but significant decreases in major risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes), while protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) all improve; the slight increase in general psychopathology remains minor, making it unlikely a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Although the person starts with multiple risk factors at T1 (low social support, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, high dysfunctional attitudes, and above-average anxiety sensitivity), most risk factors either improve or remain stable, except for a sharp drop in social support and a rise in general psychopathology. However, given that T1 already showed some mild psychological symptoms (GSI slightly above zero) and dysfunctional attitudes decrease over time, it's more consistent with an ongoing issue or worsening existing difficulties rather than the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person had a highly healthy baseline at T1 (low psychopathology, strong self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, low stress and dysfunctional attitudes) and, although some risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, general psychopathology) increased slightly by T2, there is no substantial shift or major elevation in risk indicators to suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had strong protective factors at T1, such as high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, active coping strategies, low anxiety sensitivity, and low psychopathology; most variables remained stable or improved by T2, with no significant emergence of risk factors or increase in general psychopathology."
0,"The individual already exhibited significant psychological distress and dysfunction at T1, including high stress, elevated GSI, poor self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, and extremely low social support, so any ongoing symptoms at T2 do not represent the new onset of a disorder; instead, their mental health picture is consistent with an ongoing disorder or continued distress, not the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual shows only mild baseline risk (slightly low positive mental health, mildly elevated dysfunctional attitudes) with generally average or better protective factors and no significant increases in core risk factors (GSI, anxiety sensitivity); protective domains such as life satisfaction even improve at T2 and dysfunctional attitudes decrease, so there is no clear evidence for new disorder onset."
0,"Although this individual presented with multiple significant risk factors at T1—including high stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and low social support—they already exhibited moderate psychopathology at baseline (GSI > 0). The absence of a large increase in GSI, combined with stable or improving risk factors (notably, reduced anxiety sensitivity and increased life satisfaction at T2), suggests the person did not newly develop a psychological disorder between T1 and T2—they likely had ongoing symptoms instead."
0,"Despite substantial decreases in protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support) and a moderate increase in general psychopathology, the individual started with very high positive mental health and below-average distress at T1; changes were not accompanied by marked increases in core risk factors or dysfunction, suggesting no clear development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started with a highly protective psychological profile at T1 (strong self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, low stress, very low anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes, and psychopathology). Despite a decline in life satisfaction and slight increases in risk factors, overall mental health and psychopathology remained stable and within healthy bounds, indicating no development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although the individual started with several risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, low socioeconomic status), their T2 changes show strong improvements in core protective factors (notably, large increases in life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and positive mental health; decreases in fear and anxiety measures). While GSI increased, the overall pattern is of recovery and strengthening mental health, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Despite very high initial risk factors at T1 (extremely low social support, low life satisfaction, high dysfunctional attitudes, and subpar positive mental health), there are strong protective demographic factors (high socioeconomic status and BMI), and key risk factors such as dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations substantially decreased between T1 and T2. While GSI increased, it remains within a low range, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed during this time."
0,"Despite a low socioeconomic status as a demographic risk and substantial increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology, the person started from exceptionally low risk at T1 with high social support, very low psychopathology, high protective factors, and improvements in positive mental health and life satisfaction over time, suggesting they do not cross the threshold into a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this individual exhibited extremely high general psychopathology and stress at T1 along with low protective factors (self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support), their T2 measures show marked improvement in mental health signified by dramatically decreased general psychopathology, increased social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction. Thus, there is no evidence for development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2—instead, there appears to be significant recovery."
0,"Despite initial high risk factors at T1 (elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI), there is a sharp decrease in risk factors by T2 (notably, GSI decreased substantially, with improvements in life satisfaction and self-efficacy), and no increase or new onset of psychological distress is evident—if anything, the profile suggests recovery or substantial improvement."
0,"Although this individual had low positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, alongside high stress and general psychopathology at T1, these factors were already at risk levels then; importantly, general psychopathology and most risk markers actually improved or remained stable at T2, without significant new risk factor increases, indicating no development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite sharp decreases in life satisfaction and self-efficacy, and notable increases in some risk factors (fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, GSI), there is a dramatic, unusually large rise in positive mental health and still high socioeconomic status—suggesting resilience or a protective shift, not the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started with good baseline mental health and strong protective factors, but between T1 and T2 showed marked increases in multiple risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), alongside substantial drops in self-efficacy and life satisfaction. This pattern strongly suggests the development of a psychological disorder at T2."
0,"Despite a large drop in positive mental health, most other risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations) actually improved, general psychopathology decreased, and several protective factors increased (social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction), making the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2 unlikely."
0,"Despite some demographic and baseline risk factors (low education, low socioeconomic status, low positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, moderately high dysfunctional attitudes, and elevated GSI at T1), this individual does not appear to develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2. There are improvements or stability in key protective factors (notably a large increase in positive mental health, higher self-efficacy, and a pronounced reduction in dysfunctional attitudes), and the slight increase in general psychopathology (GSI) is small and starts from an already elevated level, suggesting ongoing or chronic issues rather than new onset."
0,"The person started with high protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, low stress, low psychopathology) and showed further improvements in key risk factors over time (dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity decreased). Despite an increase in general psychopathology (GSI), the positive direction of most risk/protective factors makes new disorder development unlikely."
0,"The person started with strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, socioeconomic status, and coping skills), and by T2 shows no marked increase in general psychopathology; although life satisfaction and social support declined, positive mental health and self-efficacy increased, while risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) decreased, which does not suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite high psychological distress and several risk factors at T1, the person shows marked decreases in general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations by T2, with increased self-efficacy and social support—indicating improvement or recovery rather than new disorder onset."
0,"Although there are notable risk factors in the demographics (lower education and socioeconomic status) and an increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, the individual had low baseline risk factors at T1 (low anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and psychopathology), and key protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, and social support) actually improved from T1 to T2; thus, the overall profile does not support the onset of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The person started with relatively low risk at T1 (low psychopathology, low anxiety and fear, low dysfunctional attitudes, strong stress resilience), but showed a marked increase in general psychopathology (GSI), anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes from T1 to T2—indicating the likely development of a psychological disorder despite improvements in life satisfaction and positive mental health."
0,"The individual starts with generally strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low psychopathology, and low anxiety/fear), and shows further improvements in positive mental health and self-efficacy between T1 and T2, with no significant rise in risk factors or psychopathology; therefore, there is no indication of new psychological disorder development."
0,"The individual started with some risk (low positive mental health), but overall at T1 had moderate protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, low anxiety sensitivity, low dysfunctional attitudes, low psychopathology). At T2, despite decreased social support and life satisfaction, general psychopathology actually decreased, and there was no significant increase in key risk factors—indicating no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite a significant drop in positive mental health, the individual shows large improvements in protective factors (increased social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and reductions in key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of sensations, dysfunctional attitudes). General psychopathology remains low and slightly decreases, suggesting no new disorder developed."
1,"Although the person started with generally below-average risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction), their psychological risk status markedly worsened by T2—most notably, general psychopathology (GSI) increased substantially, along with sharp rises in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations. These escalations in central risk factors strongly suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual already showed significant psychopathology and multiple risk factors at T1 (high GSI, anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, low socioeconomic status, low social support), so any continued or worsened symptoms at T2 represent an ongoing or chronic disorder rather than the development of a new one. There is no evidence that the person was healthy at T1, thus they did not newly develop a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started at T1 with some risk factors (high fear of bodily sensations, above-average anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes) but was overall minimally distressed and reported good positive mental health and life satisfaction. By T2, protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction, and social support) increased, while risk factors and general psychopathology declined—making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"Although there are several risk factors at T1—such as low positive mental health, low social support, low life satisfaction, high emotion-focused coping, high fear of bodily sensations, and high dysfunctional attitudes—the overall general psychopathology was below average, and the small increase in GSI between T1 and T2 remains minimal. Despite some deteriorations (notably in self-efficacy, positive mental health, and life satisfaction), there is no substantial evidence of a new psychological disorder emerging, especially as the GSI increase is very slight and key risk factors (like dysfunctional attitudes and fear of bodily sensations) actually decrease."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status (risk factor), the person had strong protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support, with low psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes). Although there were notable decreases in positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction at T2, the absence of increases in general psychopathology or risk factors (in fact, most risk factors like anxiety sensitivity decreased) suggests that no new psychological disorder likely developed."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 (elevated stress, below average problem- and emotion-focused coping, and moderately low positive mental health), the individual’s protective factors (high social support, above average life satisfaction, and low baseline psychopathology) are notable. Although there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology from T1 to T2 and reductions in some protective variables, there is no strong evidence of a new disorder developing, especially given the low-to-average risk factor profile and the absence of a dramatic shift in key psychological risk variables."
0,"Despite a moderate increase in general psychopathology and a marked decrease in life satisfaction and social support at T2, the person started with low psychopathology, low risk factors, and average-to-protective factors; no single change or combination suggests onset of a new disorder, but rather some deterioration within a healthy-to-subclinical range."
0,"Although there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology and decreases in protective factors like self-efficacy and life satisfaction, the individual started with very strong protective factors at T1 (low stress, high life satisfaction, strong social support, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes) and only mild to moderate worsening occurred, without shifts into clearly high-risk values. No evidence suggests a shift from health to clear disorder status."
0,"Despite a large increase in GSI (psychopathology) and a significant decrease in positive mental health at T2, the person already exhibited extremely low life satisfaction and highly dysfunctional attitudes at T1, suggesting longstanding difficulties rather than the development of a new disorder; no clear shift from a psychologically healthy baseline to disorder is evident."
0,"The individual had very poor mental health and multiple risk factors (extremely low social support, life satisfaction, and high dysfunctional attitudes) already at T1, but between T1 and T2, nearly all risk factors improved dramatically (increased social support and life satisfaction, decreased dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology). This pattern indicates recovery or improvement, not the onset of a new disorder."
0,"The person started with relatively low risk (below-average psychopathology and anxiety sensitivity, low dysfunctional attitudes, and good life satisfaction), and although there was a small increase in general psychopathology and loss of some life satisfaction, positive mental health and self-efficacy both improved significantly, with no substantial increase in major risk factors; this pattern does not suggest the new onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite substantial increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations and a marked drop in positive mental health and life satisfaction, the person started with high resilience and protective factors (excellent self-efficacy, social support, and positive mental health), and importantly, general psychopathology (GSI) actually decreased at T2, suggesting no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The individual already shows elevated psychopathology and several risk factors at T1 (high stress, GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations), meaning they likely already have a psychological disorder at baseline; while risk factors persist or worsen between T1 and T2, this does not reflect development of a new disorder, just continuation or worsening of an existing problem."
0,"The individual demonstrates substantial protective factors at T1 (strong social support, low stress, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low psychopathology), and although there is a modest increase in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes at T2, most risk factors remain low or decrease (notably large decreases in fear of bodily sensations and anxiety sensitivity). The overall pattern does not indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started with generally low risk and high protective factors at T1 (very low dysfunctional attitudes, low distress, high life satisfaction), but by T2 showed substantial increases in risk factors—particularly a notable rise in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and psychological distress (GSI)—along with strong decreases in protective factors such as social support and life satisfaction; this pattern strongly suggests the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low education and socioeconomic status (risk factors), the person started with low psychological distress, very low dysfunctional attitudes, good coping, and high social support at T1 (protective factors). Although there were increases in risk factors (especially in GSI and dysfunctional attitudes) and declines in self-efficacy, baseline protective factors and only mild shifts in positive mental health and life satisfaction suggest the person experienced some deterioration but likely did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although this person showed relatively high psychopathology (GSI), dysfunctional attitudes, and low self-efficacy at T1, there is a strong decrease in general psychopathology and risk factors from T1 to T2, with no significant increase in risk. These patterns indicate no new disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there is an increase in risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations between T1 and T2, the individual started out with strong protective demographic variables (high education and socioeconomic status, low BMI), had low baseline psychopathology, and shows improvement in key protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy). The overall profile does not indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low education (risk factor) and a sharp decrease in self-efficacy plus notable increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, the person started at T1 with a very low risk profile (all mental health symptom measures strongly negative, indicating strong resilience and absence of psychopathology). Although there is some deterioration, the baseline mental health was highly robust, and even with these increases, the individual is unlikely to have crossed the threshold to develop a new psychological disorder at T2."
0,"Despite low positive mental health and life satisfaction at T1, the individual’s initial risk was offset by low stress and psychopathology, above-average self-efficacy, and increasing protective factors (e.g., higher positive mental health and life satisfaction at T2). Although general self-efficacy and certain risk factors worsened, the changes do not reach the magnitude or pattern consistent with the development of a new psychological disorder, and overall psychopathology remains low."
0,"Although there is a large drop in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction) and an increase in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, the person already had a psychological disorder at T1 as indicated by a strongly elevated GSI (1.25), dysfunctional attitudes (1.44), and low self-efficacy; thus, these changes reflect ongoing or possibly fluctuating psychopathology rather than the new development of a disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person already displayed a high level of psychopathology and multiple risk factors at T1 (elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), indicating a likely existing psychological disorder at baseline rather than the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2. While several risk factors worsened from T1 to T2, the profile suggests continuity or worsening of an existing disorder, not the emergence of a new one in an initially healthy individual."
1,"The individual started with several risk factors at T1 (very low positive mental health, low social support, very low life satisfaction, and low socioeconomic status) and exhibited substantial increases in psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, and decreases in self-efficacy and life satisfaction from T1 to T2—strongly suggesting the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The person started with low risk at T1—low psychopathology, high self-efficacy, and very low anxiety sensitivity/fear—with only slightly elevated dysfunctional attitudes. However, T2 brought a strong increase in general psychopathology, sharp rises in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, a notable drop in life satisfaction, and increased dysfunctional attitudes, indicating a high likelihood of developing a psychological disorder."
0,"Although this individual had below-average protective factors and moderately elevated risk factors at T1, nearly all indicators improved from T1 to T2 (notably, increased self-efficacy and social support, reduced dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology), indicating recovery or resilience rather than new disorder onset."
0,"The person showed elevated risk factors at T1 with low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, high dysfunctional attitudes, and above-average general psychopathology, indicating they were likely already experiencing significant psychological difficulties at baseline. No new disorder development is indicated, as some risk factors (positive mental health, dysfunctional attitudes, general psychopathology) actually improved or decreased from T1 to T2, reflecting either ongoing difficulties or partial recovery rather than new onset."
0,"While the individual exhibited significant psychological distress and multiple risk factors at T1, all indicators of mental health and well-being substantially improved by T2 (e.g., sharp decreases in general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and notable increases in positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction), strongly suggesting recovery rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite increased anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology at T2, there are substantial increases in protective factors such as positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, while dysfunctional attitudes decrease and overall risk at baseline was low; this profile suggests increased resilience and does not indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The person was relatively psychologically healthy at T1, but experienced a large increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and dysfunctional attitudes, along with a major drop in life satisfaction between T1 and T2, indicating the development of a new psychological disorder despite strong socioeconomic status and moderate social support."
0,"Although the individual started with very low social support, elevated stress, high dysfunctional attitudes, and above-average general psychopathology at T1 (suggesting ongoing or prior difficulties), there is no evidence of new disorder onset: key protective factors (self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support) improved between T1 and T2, and psychological distress (GSI) decreased, indicating a trend toward recovery or stability rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite very low socioeconomic status and education (risk factors) and a substantial drop in social support and life satisfaction from T1 to T2, the person started with no psychological disorder at T1, had moderate protective factors (e.g., coping and self-efficacy), no large increases in key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, or GSI), and notably showed a substantial increase in positive mental health at T2, suggesting they did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with very strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, low stress, low psychopathology, and low dysfunctional attitudes), and although there are moderate increases in risk factors (notably a decrease in self-efficacy and life satisfaction, and a mild increase in overall psychopathology), the baseline was extremely healthy and risk levels at T2 do not appear high enough to indicate the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual began with strong protective factors (high socioeconomic status, robust social support, very low anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, low psychopathology at T1). Although there was a notable drop in life satisfaction and positive mental health at T2, there were concurrent improvements in social support and no substantial increase in risk factors like GSI or anxiety sensitivity—overall risk remains low for developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although socioeconomic status is low (risk factor), the person displayed considerable improvements in positive mental health and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, while anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations notably decreased and general psychopathology remained low. Despite some increases in dysfunctional attitudes and reductions in social support and self-efficacy, there is no substantial evidence of overall psychological deterioration or new clinically significant distress, making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
1,"Although the individual exhibited strong protective factors and moderate risk at T1, there were pronounced increases in several risk indicators between T1 and T2—most notably, strong rises in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and overall psychopathology (GSI). This drastic worsening of key mental health variables signals the likely development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there was an increase in general psychopathology and a decrease in life satisfaction at T2, the individual started with strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, low dysfunctional attitudes, low general psychopathology), and protective factors such as general self-efficacy remained stable; dysfunctional attitudes actually decreased markedly at T2, which typically reduces risk. Thus, it is unlikely that this person developed a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some demographic risk factors (lower education and socioeconomic status, above-average BMI), this individual had extremely strong protective factors at T1 (very high life satisfaction and social support, low stress and psychopathology, very low dysfunctional attitudes). While there were declines in positive mental health and a rise in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology, the changes did not move the person to above-average risk, and key protective factors and low baseline risk suggest no new disorder developed."
0,"Although there is a notable increase in general psychopathology and a strong drop in social support from T1 to T2, the individual started with only mild risk (slightly elevated stress and low life satisfaction but average to above-average self-efficacy and coping, and low baseline psychopathology). Most protective factors (self-efficacy, coping) remain adequate, and improvements in positive mental health and life satisfaction suggest resilience rather than clear disorder onset."
0,"The individual started with some risk factors at T1, such as low positive mental health and self-efficacy, but also had strong protective factors: high social support, low stress, high life satisfaction, outstanding problem-focused coping, low psychopathology, and low dysfunctional attitudes. From T1 to T2, there were improvements in protective factors (increases in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, decrease in dysfunctional attitudes and fear of bodily sensations), and while general psychopathology increased somewhat, the strong overall protective pattern and positive developments suggest no onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there is a notable decline in protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) and a strong increase in dysfunctional attitudes, the individual already exhibited elevated psychopathology at T1 (GSI: 0.78), suggesting a pre-existing disorder rather than a new onset. The overall drop in GSI (-0.60) between T1 and T2 actually points to a reduction in general psychological distress, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Despite an increase in multiple risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) and a large decrease in protective factors (self-efficacy and life satisfaction) between T1 and T2, the individual starts with a healthy baseline (low GSI and negative dysfunctional attitudes at T1), and GSI remains nearly unchanged and still healthy; the overall increase in general psychopathology is minimal, suggesting no new psychological disorder development."
1,"The individual started with below-average positive mental health and life satisfaction, very low self-efficacy, and average to low risk factors but experienced a sharp drop in social support, a notable increase in anxiety sensitivity, and a substantial rise in general psychopathology between T1 and T2—indicating likely development of a psychological disorder."
1,"The individual began with strong protective factors and few risk factors at T1, but experienced substantial increases in risk variables such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology by T2, despite continued protective demographic and coping factors—this pattern indicates the likely development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual began with several protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low psychopathology), and these mostly increased further at T2, while risk factors like psychopathology and anxiety sensitivity decreased, indicating improved mental health rather than the development of a new disorder."
0,"The person began with several protective factors (good social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress, strong coping, low psychopathology) and these either remained stable or improved—social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction increased, dysfunctional attitudes and psychopathology decreased, and risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations) stayed low. There is no evidence of new significant risk or deterioration indicating the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although there is a marked drop in positive mental health and substantial increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, key risk factors (general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes) remain moderate or improve, and protective factors such as self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction all increase; therefore, despite a complex risk profile, the evidence does not convincingly support the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite a very large drop in positive mental health and a moderate increase in general psychopathology at T2, the individual’s risk factors either improved (lower dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations) or remained low. Simultaneously, major protective factors such as general self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support markedly increased, indicating overall improved coping capacities and resilience, making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"The individual had a very low risk profile at T1 with low psychopathology, high life satisfaction, low stress, and low anxiety/fear measures. Although life satisfaction decreased, all other protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support) improved substantially and risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) decreased further, suggesting improved well-being rather than disorder development."
1,"The individual had high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations with low social support and self-efficacy at T1 (some risk factors, though GSI was only average), and experienced a large increase in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes at T2, along with a sharp decline in life satisfaction. This pattern suggests the onset of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person started with considerable psychological distress and risk factors at T1 (low mental health, self-efficacy, social support, high dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI) but improved on multiple fronts by T2 (reduced psychopathology, better positive mental health and life satisfaction, decreased dysfunctional attitudes), suggesting no new disorder developed—instead, the data supports partial recovery or improvement."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status as a risk factor, the person started with relatively low distress and many protective factors (low anxiety sensitivity, low dysfunctional attitudes, low GSI), and showed improvements in positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and a decrease in general psychopathology from T1 to T2; these patterns suggest continued psychological health without developing a new disorder."
1,"Although this person started with high protective factors (education, socioeconomic status, social support, and life satisfaction), they had low positive mental health and high stress at T1, and from T1 to T2 experienced significant increases in dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations, general psychopathology (GSI), and a large drop in life satisfaction—together these changes strongly suggest the development of a new psychological disorder at T2."
0,"This individual began with multiple strong protective factors at T1 (very low psychopathology, high self-efficacy, strong social support, low risk attitudes/symptoms) and, while there were mild increases in general psychopathology and decreases in self-efficacy by T2, overall mental health actually improved (notably in positive mental health and life satisfaction) and risk factors remained low; this pattern is inconsistent with the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1, including low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, low anxiety sensitivity, low stress, and high life satisfaction; although there is some deterioration (e.g., decreased positive mental health, life satisfaction, and social support, and increases in GSI, fear, and dysfunctional attitudes), the magnitudes remain mostly in the healthy range without a marked shift to above-average risk, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"The individual already exhibited significant psychological distress and risk factors at T1 (high stress, low self-efficacy, extremely low life satisfaction, high general psychopathology, and problematic coping) indicating a likely ongoing psychological disorder, not a new-onset between T1 and T2; thus, any increase in symptoms reflects persistence or worsening, not the development of a new disorder."
0,"The individual began with several protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and low general psychopathology), and over time, these protective factors further improved (notably increases in self-efficacy and positive mental health, decreased anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes). The lack of significant increases in risk factors or GSI and overall improved psychological profile make it unlikely that they developed a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although the individual showed very low protective factors and high risk factors at T1 (poor mental health, extremely low self-efficacy, low social support, high dysfunctional attitudes), their psychological state substantially improved by T2 (notably large gains in self-efficacy and social support, decreased dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology), making it unlikely they developed a new psychological disorder during this period."
0,"The person starts with strong protective factors at T1—low stress and psychopathology, low anxiety/fear, positive life satisfaction, and high social support—despite low self-efficacy. Although there is a marked decrease in self-efficacy and an increase in general psychopathology from T1 to T2, other protective factors (notably large increases in positive mental health and life satisfaction) offset these risks, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Although there is an increase in some risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology, the person started with robust protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, low dysfunctional attitudes, low anxiety/fear), and positive mental health notably improved by T2 despite some loss in life satisfaction and self-efficacy; the overall pattern does not clearly indicate onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with relatively low risk (low distress, low dysfunctional attitudes) and showed improvements in most protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction), despite an increase in general psychopathology at T2. The robust rise in protective factors and lack of extreme risk indicators suggest that no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite extremely low protective factors and high risk factors at T1 (notably very low self-efficacy and life satisfaction, high stress, dysfunctional attitudes, and fear of bodily sensations), the positive GSI change and drop in positive mental health suggest worsening, but the person already exhibited clear psychopathological symptoms at T1, so this pattern most likely reflects an ongoing or persisting disorder rather than the development of a new one between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status (risk factor), this individual started with mostly average to positive mental health variables, high coping resources, and strong social support. Between T1 and T2, their protective factors (positive mental health, general self-efficacy) increased while psychopathology decreased, and key risk factors did not significantly worsen—indicating they did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with below-average positive mental health and social support at T1, but showed substantial improvements in these protective factors and reductions in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology) from T1 to T2, indicating improved psychological well-being and no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual began with strong protective factors (high positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy, low general psychopathology and anxiety sensitivity) and, despite a sharp drop in social support and increased anxiety sensitivity, improvements across well-being variables (notably life satisfaction and self-efficacy) and a decrease in general psychopathology make it unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual already exhibited significant psychological risk factors and likely an existing disorder at T1 (notably high anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), and while their mental health remained poor or worsened, this does not represent a new onset disorder between T1 and T2, but rather a continuation or worsening of ongoing difficulties."
0,"The individual started with many protective factors at T1 (high life satisfaction and social support, low stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear, and psychopathology), and although there are moderate declines in positive mental health and life satisfaction alongside some increase in dysfunctional attitudes, the overall psychological distress remains low with only minor increase. There is no strong evidence of significant new psychological disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started with some below-average protective factors (e.g., positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) but also had low stress, decent social support, and no marked psychopathology or high-risk attitudes at T1; key risk factors did not increase meaningfully between T1 and T2, and general psychopathology slightly decreased, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some initial risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, high dysfunctional attitudes), the person demonstrated significant positive changes from T1 to T2, including marked increases in general self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and positive mental health, alongside decreases in anxiety sensitivity and maintained low general psychopathology. These improvements indicate protective developments that reduce the likelihood of developing a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite significant social and financial disadvantage, the individual exhibited marked improvements in protective factors (large increases in social support, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy) and substantial decreases in the main risk factor (dysfunctional attitudes), while risk indicators (GSI and anxiety sensitivity) remained low; there is no evidence of new disorder development between T1 and T2."
