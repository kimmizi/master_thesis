General self-efficacy is slightly increased, indicating that the individual has confidence in coping with a variety of stressful demands. Life satisfaction is above average, indicating their satisfaction with different life areas (e.g., health, occupation, leisure time).\n",

Life satisfaction increases in T2, which indicates a positive development. Anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes strongly increase in T2, indicating that the person now much beliefs that anxiety leads to harmful consequences and they strongly agree with irrational beliefs related to depression.
