"Knowledge conflicts

Reasoning
 Lack of context dominates as the prompt fails to specify diagnostic thresholds for FDIPS interviews",1
leaving interpretation of standardized scores ambiguous eg,1
"whether GSI constitutes a formal diagnosis at T
 Lack of opinionbased information is critical",1
as clinical judgment about symptom severity and diagnostic boundaries is absent,1
"reducing complex assessments to quantitative thresholds
 Lack of examples contributes by omitting reference cases demonstrating how similar symptom profiles translate to diagnoses in this specific assessment framework
 Knowledge conflicts may exist regarding whether high GSI scores alone constitute disorder diagnosis versus requiring specific symptom patterns per diagnostic manuals",1
