"Lack of counterfactual demonstrations  

Explanation  
The misclassification primarily stems from Lack of opinionbased information",1
as the model relied solely on quantitative symptom changes eg,1
"large increases in GSI and dysfunctional attitudes without clinical interpretation of diagnostic thresholds or contextual significance  
Lack of examples and Lack of counterfactual demonstrations are secondary factors",1
as representative cases showing similar symptom fluctuations without disorder developmentor contrasting cases illustrating diagnostic boundarieswere absent in the prompt,1
"Lack of context

Key reasons  
 Lack of opinionbased information dominates as the model failed to incorporate clinical judgment about protective factors high baseline selfefficacysocial support buffering deterioration  
 Lack of counterfactual demonstrations prevented recognition that symptom increases may not cross diagnostic thresholds when starting from subclinical baselines  
 Lack of context regarding diagnostic thresholds and resilience mechanisms in psychological assessments contributed to overreliance on symptom deltas",1
