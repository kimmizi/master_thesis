For example high emotion-focused coping might reduce the risk of developing a psychological disorder (e.g., because you experience less stress) or increase the risk (e.g., because you don’t really solve the problem). Equivalently, low emotion-focused coping might reduce the risk (e.g., because you don’t need to cope if you don’t have any problems) or increase the risk (e.g., because you lack an efficient way of handling your stress).\n",
    "Consider the magnitude and direction of the variables.

    "\n",
    "Second, I analyze the baseline mental health at T1: Positive mental health is average, indicating that the person believes that life has a meaning. Social support is below average (negative): the individual perceives that they do not receive much support from their social environment. General self-efficacy is slightly increased, indicating that the individual has confidence in coping with a variety of stressful demands. Life satisfaction is above average, indicating their satisfaction with different life areas (e.g., health, occupation, leisure time).\n",
    "Stress is below average, indicating that they are not experiencing a lot of stress from life events and daily hassles. The strongly negative problem- and emotion focused coping indicate that they do not activate resources to solve the stressinducing problem nor try to ease inner tension without trying to solve the problem.\n",
    "Anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations are negative, indicating low believe in that anxiety and its accompanying symptoms may lead to physically, psychologically, or socially harmful consequences and that they have a low fear of sensations mostly related to autonomic arousal. Dysfunctional attitudes are positive, meaning that they agreed with irrational beliefs and faulty assumptions about reality that are etiologically related to depression. Finally, general psychopathology is negative, indicating a low overall psychological distress.\n",
    "To summarize an overall trend in T1, the person seems to be relatively healthy and happy. They have good positive mental health, good self-efficacy, and good life satisfaction. They had little stress, coping, anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations and low overall psychological distress. However, they have slightly higher dysfunctional attitudes and few social support, indicating a potential for developing a psychological disorder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, analyze the changes between T1 and T2: Positive mental health and general self-efficacy decrease in T2, indicating that they believe less in themselves and in a meaning of life. Social support is similar to T1, which means it is still negative and the person does not feel like they are being socially supported. Life satisfaction increases in T2, which indicates a positive development. Anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes strongly increase in T2, indicating that the person now much beliefs that anxiety leads to harmful consequences and they strongly agree with irrational beliefs related to depression. However, fear of bodily sensations decreases slightly. General psychopathology slightly increases, but is still average. To summarize an general trend in T2, the person is feeling significantly worse than in T1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I make my final decision and output:\n",
    "Prediction: YES\n",
    "Explanation: I believe that the person was psychologically healthy at T1 with an average and relatively good mental health and socioeconomic status, positive thinking, low distress and low fear, however already lacking social support, having very low coping skills and slightly dysfunctional attitudes. In T2, the person showed a worsened picture and I believe they developed a psychological disorder: decreased protective factors, such as positive mental health and general self-efficacy, and increased risk factors, such as anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, and importantly: dysfunctional attitudes increased strongly.\n",

      "First, I analyze the demographic variables: Since education, BMI and socioeconomic status are all zero, all of them are average. There are seemingly no important demographic risk or protective factors, nor a strong magnitude or trend of these variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, I analyze the baseline mental health at T1: Positive mental health is average, indicating that the person believes that life has a meaning. Social support is below average (negative): the individual perceives that they do not receive much support from their social environment. General self-efficacy is slightly increased, indicating that the individual has confidence in coping with a variety of stressful demands. Life satisfaction is above average, indicating their satisfaction with different life areas (e.g., health, occupation, leisure time).\n",
      "Stress is below average, indicating that they are not experiencing a lot of stress from life events and daily hassles. The strongly negative problem- and emotion focused coping indicate that they do not activate resources to solve the stressinducing problem nor try to ease inner tension without trying to solve the problem.\n",
      "Anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations are negative, indicating low believe in that anxiety and its accompanying symptoms may lead to physically, psychologically, or socially harmful consequences and that they have a low fear of sensations mostly related to autonomic arousal. Dysfunctional attitudes are positive, meaning that they agreed with irrational beliefs and faulty assumptions about reality that are etiologically related to depression. Finally, general psychopathology is negative, indicating a low overall psychological distress.\n",
      "To summarize an overall trend in T1, the person seems to be relatively healthy and happy. They have good positive mental health, good self-efficacy, and good life satisfaction. They had little stress, coping, anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations and low overall psychological distress. However, they have slightly higher dysfunctional attitudes and few social support, indicating a potential for developing a psychological disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, analyze the changes between T1 and T2: Positive mental health and general self-efficacy decrease in T2, indicating that they believe less in themselves and in a meaning of life. Social support is similar to T1, which means it is still negative and the person does not feel like they are being socially supported. Life satisfaction increases in T2, which indicates a positive development. Anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes strongly increase in T2, indicating that the person now much beliefs that anxiety leads to harmful consequences and they strongly agree with irrational beliefs related to depression. However, fear of bodily sensations decreases slightly. General psychopathology slightly increases, but is still average. To summarize an general trend in T2, the person is feeling significantly worse than in T1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I make my final decision and output:\n",
      "Prediction: YES\n",
      "Explanation: I believe that the person was psychologically healthy at T1 with an average and relatively good mental health and socioeconomic status, positive thinking, low distress and low fear, however already lacking social support, having very low coping skills and slightly dysfunctional attitudes. In T2, the person showed a worsened picture and I believe they developed a psychological disorder: decreased protective factors, such as positive mental health and general self-efficacy, and increased risk factors, such as anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, and importantly: dysfunctional attitudes increased strongly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t over interpret this correctly classified example and don’t overly stick to this. Only because in this example, the decision was based on some specific variables, does not mean that these are generally more important. Magnitudes, directions, interactions and interpretations of variables always differ and depent on the specific case. Each person is a new individual assessment. After your assessment, provide your prediction as either YES or NO, followed by a brief explanation (no more than two sentences) supporting your decision.\n",
