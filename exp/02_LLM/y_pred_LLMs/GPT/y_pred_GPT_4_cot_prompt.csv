0,"The individual was already somewhat average or slightly above average on risk factors at T1 but did not show elevated psychopathology; by T2, most risk factors (positive mental health, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology) actually decreased or improved, while social support increased, suggesting greater resilience. There is no evidence of new psychological disorder development; rather, the overall change indicates improved or stable mental health."
0,"Although the individual had significant risk factors at T1—including very low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, and high general psychopathology—the drop in GSI between T1 and T2 suggests remission or improvement rather than onset, and no new substantial worsening of protective/risk factors indicates new disorder development. The individual was not healthy at T1 but appears to be recovering or stable, so no new disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual began with robust protective factors at T1—very high self-efficacy, strong problem-focused coping, low psychopathology, high social support, and satisfaction—with only one risk factor (low positive mental health). From T1 to T2, nearly all protective factors increased further (notably life satisfaction and social support) and all risk factors either improved or remained low, with only a modest rise in general psychopathology that remains within a healthy range; thus, there is no evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Although the individual had robust protective factors and very low risk at T1 (high social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and low stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes, and psychopathology), there was a substantial rise in multiple risk factors (notably large increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology) and loss of protective factors between T1 and T2—indicating likely onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, very low psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, extremely low anxiety/fear), and despite substantial decreases in self-efficacy and life satisfaction by T2, risk factors did not increase and general psychopathology even decreased. There is no evidence of new onset of a psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started with low positive mental health, very low social support, and moderate protective factors but then exhibited large increases in general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations between T1 and T2; these shifts indicate the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although there is a notable decline in self-efficacy and rises in dysfunctional attitudes and fear of bodily sensations, the individual starts from a highly resilient baseline (very high self-efficacy, low dysfunctional attitudes, average to low psychopathology) and shows improvements in positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction; the overall change in general psychopathology is minor and not enough to indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with low protective factors and moderate risk factors, but showed clear improvements in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction from T1 to T2, with only a mild increase in risk factors and general psychopathology that remained in the average range; overall, this trajectory does not indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The person starts with several protective factors at T1 (low stress, high life satisfaction, low psychopathology) but exhibits a marked increase in major risk factors at T2—including substantial rises in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and especially dysfunctional attitudes—along with a concurrent decline in positive mental health, all of which point toward new onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual starts with low positive mental health and life satisfaction, but also has low stress and average psychopathology at T1. By T2, key protective factors (positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy) improve substantially and general psychopathology decreases, indicating no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and coping skills, with low stress and psychopathology), and although there was a sharp decrease in social support and a mild increase in psychopathology by T2, positive mental health and dysfunctional attitudes remained relatively stable and most risk factors did not rise substantially. This pattern suggests emotional challenges but not the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite substantial drops in positive mental health and self-efficacy at T2, there is a marked increase in life satisfaction, stable or reduced risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, GSI), and no increase in dysfunctional attitudes or psychopathology; this pattern does not support the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person began with average mental health and coping, some mild stress and psychopathology, but showed improvements over time—such as decreased general psychopathology, fear of bodily sensations, and anxiety sensitivity; despite some declines in positive mental health and life satisfaction, there is no indication of new disorder development, only some shifts in mood and wellbeing."
0,"The person started with some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low social support, high anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations), but from T1 to T2, social support and life satisfaction increased significantly, positive mental health improved, anxiety sensitivity and GSI decreased, and there were no marked increases in psychopathology. This pattern does not indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status (risk factor) and initial high general psychopathology at T1, the individual already appeared to have a psychological disorder at T1, not developing a new one by T2. Protective changes include a large decrease in GSI, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes, with no evidence of new disorder onset—rather, there is improvement from a previously impaired baseline."
0,"Although there was a drop in self-efficacy and an increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology, the individual started with low risk (very low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, low anxiety sensitivity, low fear, and above-average life satisfaction), and the increases remain at or near average levels. Protective factors (increased social support, improved positive mental health, stable life satisfaction) combined with the absence of high-risk values suggest no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Despite demographic risk factors (low education, low SES) and high T1 stress/dysfunctional attitudes, there is no evidence of new disorder development: T1 GSI indicates no clinical psychopathology, and from T1 to T2, overall risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, GSI, stress) decline and protective factors (life satisfaction, social support) increase, suggesting improved—not deteriorated—mental health."
0,"Although socioeconomic status is low (risk factor) and baseline stress is high, this person starts with high positive mental health, adequate social support, high self-efficacy, and low psychopathology (protective factors), then shows improvements in positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support, and self-efficacy by T2. While there is an increase in general psychopathology, no critical risk markers or dramatic negative shifts suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual starts with some significant risk factors at T1 (low education and SES, high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction), and over time, their general psychopathology increases notably and social support drops substantially, suggesting new-onset psychological difficulties despite slight improvements in other risk domains."
1,"Despite high social support and coping abilities at T1, this person had elevated anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations (both strong risk factors). These risk factors increased further by T2 along with significant rises in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology (GSI), all indicating a clear movement from a relatively healthy baseline toward the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual started with several risk factors at T1 (low life satisfaction, moderate psychological distress, high dysfunctional attitudes, and anxiety-related variables), they showed meaningful improvements in key protective factors between T1 and T2, including increased positive mental health, self-efficacy, and social support, while risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations decreased, suggesting resilience rather than the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this person showed risk factors at T1 such as low education, low BMI, high stress, low positive mental health, high dysfunctional attitudes, and only average life satisfaction, their T2 changes were positive: large increases in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, alongside marked decreases in anxiety sensitivity, fear, and dysfunctional attitudes. The small increase in general psychopathology is less concerning given these substantial improvements in protective factors, indicating no new disorder developed."
1,"Although the individual started with low education and socioeconomic status (risk factors) and very low self-efficacy and positive mental health at T1, they initially showed low overall psychological distress. However, by T2, there was a dramatic increase in general psychopathology (GSI), sharp drops in life satisfaction and social support, and marked increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, suggesting the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite ongoing risk factors such as low socioeconomic status, high stress, low life satisfaction, high dysfunctional attitudes, and a slight increase in general psychopathology, this person did not exhibit a transition from psychological health to disorder; their baseline was already somewhat at risk but stable, and no abrupt or severe worsening occurred between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some risk factors at T1 (high GSI, high fear of bodily sensations, and low self-efficacy), the individual experiences significant reductions in risk factors and psychopathology between T1 and T2 (notably a large decline in GSI and fear of bodily sensations), along with no dramatic increase in dysfunctional attitudes or new risk factors, indicating no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The person started with moderately impaired positive mental health, low self-efficacy, and some psychological distress, but baseline risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes) were well below average. From T1 to T2, key protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support) improved substantially, while general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes decreased, indicating a shift toward better psychological functioning rather than the emergence of a new disorder."
0,"Despite some ongoing risk factors at T1 (high stress, low self-efficacy, elevated GSI, high fear of bodily sensations), key protective factors such as life satisfaction and social support remain high or increase, while major symptoms including general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, and fear of bodily sensations actually decrease between T1 and T2, suggesting either stability or improvement, not the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite substantial socioeconomic and social support risk factors, the individual started with low psychopathology, very low dysfunctional attitudes, and slightly above-average self-efficacy; although some risk factors increased at T2 (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, GSI), protective factors like positive mental health and self-efficacy also improved, and overall the changes do not indicate a sufficient shift from a healthy baseline to support the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with low positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, but also low general psychopathology and strong protective factors (good social support, low dysfunctional attitudes). Over time, several protective factors increased substantially (notably self-efficacy and life satisfaction), and although there was a moderate rise in general psychopathology, there is no clear shift from healthy to disordered—rather, these changes reflect a move toward better functioning, not new disorder development."
0,"Despite significant baseline risk factors at T1 (very low social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and high dysfunctional attitudes), key risk factors either improved or remained stable by T2: positive mental health and life satisfaction increased, dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity decreased, and overall psychopathology stayed low, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low education and socioeconomic status (risk factors), the individual started with robust protective psychological factors at T1 (low psychopathology, low stress, high self-efficacy) and showed substantial improvements from T1 to T2—especially in life satisfaction, social support, and a significant reduction in dysfunctional attitudes—indicating no emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual already exhibited extremely high psychopathology (GSI), dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations at T1, suggesting an existing psychological disorder. There is no evidence of new disorder development between T1 and T2—in fact, general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes sharply decreased, indicating improvement rather than onset of a new disorder."
0,"Although the person started with some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, above-average psychopathology), key risk factors generally improved or stayed stable over time: general psychopathology and life satisfaction decreased, but general self-efficacy and positive mental health increased, and the already high socioeconomic status is a strong, stable protective factor—all suggesting no new disorder developed between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, strong social support, low stress, low psychopathology), but showed dramatic increases in risk factors from T1 to T2 including a large rise in general psychopathology (GSI), dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations, anxiety sensitivity, and a substantial decline in self-efficacy and social support, all of which strongly suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although some protective factors such as self-efficacy and life satisfaction decreased and general psychopathology increased between T1 and T2, the individual's baseline (T1) mental health was highly positive (very low psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear, as well as strong self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction), and the overall changes do not reach the magnitude or direction typically indicative of new psychological disorder development."
0,"Although there is a sharp drop in protective factors such as self-efficacy and positive mental health, and increases in risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, the person already displayed elevated general psychopathology at T1 (GSI = 0.49), indicating likely pre-existing psychological difficulties, and GSI actually decreases from T1 to T2. The data suggest continued or improving symptoms rather than the onset of a new disorder."
0,"Despite some decreases in protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support) and a moderate increase in general psychopathology, the individual began with exceptionally strong protective factors (notably very high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and problem-focused coping, and very low distress and risk factors). The changes do not represent a sufficient shift from this highly resilient baseline to indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some increases in anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology, the person started with very strong protective factors (high education, high socioeconomic status, high self-efficacy, low risk factors at T1) and shows only moderate increases in risk variables, with improvements in positive mental health and life satisfaction, making it unlikely they developed a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although this individual started with relatively low protective factors (low positive mental health, social support, and self-efficacy) and some mild distress, all key protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) improved markedly by T2, while general psychopathology decreased, indicating reduced risk of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite extremely high risk factors and clear indications of severe psychological problems at T1 (high GSI, extremely low support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, and high dysfunctional attitudes), there was no new disorder developed between T1 and T2, as the person was already psychologically unwell at T1; notable improvements in key areas (GSI dropped sharply, increases in protective factors) support that no *new* disorder developed."
0,"Although there are notable decreases in positive mental health and increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, the individual started from a highly protective baseline with strong mental health, high self-efficacy, and low psychopathology, and there is no clinically significant rise in general psychopathology or dysfunctional attitudes at T2, making new disorder onset unlikely."
1,"The person started out psychologically healthy at T1, with strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, social support, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes), but showed substantial increases in risk factors by T2: notably, a large rise in general psychopathology (GSI), dysfunctional attitudes, and anxiety sensitivity, combined with a decline in social support and self-efficacy, indicating new onset of psychological disorder."
0,"Although the person started with several risk factors at T1 (low education, low social support, high stress, high dysfunctional attitudes, and moderate psychopathology), their functioning improved by T2: protective factors such as social support, positive mental health, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy all increased, while risk markers like dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology decreased—suggesting no new onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started at T1 with below-average positive mental health and self-efficacy, but strong protective factors such as high social support, high life satisfaction, low stress, low fear of bodily sensations, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low psychopathology. From T1 to T2, most risk factors further decreased (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes), positive mental health and self-efficacy improved, and although there was a modest increase in general psychopathology, the overall pattern suggests they did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual began with average to favorable protective factors (good self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low GSI, high social support, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low anxiety/fear), and although some risk factors slightly increased (notably fear of bodily sensations and dysfunctional attitudes), overall mental health, life satisfaction, and GSI remained stable or improved, with no substantial shift toward psychological disorder development."
0,"Although there are some notable risk factors—such as very high T1 stress, high initial fear of bodily sensations, a substantial drop in social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, and a rise in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology—the person started with low general psychopathology (GSI) at T1, and the overall increase in GSI is modest. There is no clear evidence of a transition from health to disorder, but rather worsening well-being in someone likely already at risk; thus, no new psychological disorder is indicated between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there are some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, high fear of bodily sensations, and slightly elevated dysfunctional attitudes), there is no significant increase in general psychopathology (GSI) or dysfunctional attitudes from T1 to T2, and most protective and risk factors show only modest changes; thus, the pattern does not strongly suggest the development of a new psychological disorder during this period."
0,"Despite their initially low positive mental health and elevated anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations at T1, this person actually demonstrated slight improvements or stability in key risk factors and protective factors between T1 and T2, with no increase in general psychopathology and a substantial decrease in dysfunctional attitudes, making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"Although some protective factors decreased and several risk factors increased between T1 and T2, the individual already displayed very high general psychopathology (GSI) at T1, indicating an ongoing psychological disorder rather than the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual starts with some risk factors (elevated stress and anxiety sensitivity, low self-efficacy, below-average positive mental health), but also has several protective factors (good social support, average life satisfaction, strong coping). Although there is a slight worsening in psychosocial well-being (declines in positive mental health, life satisfaction, and social support, and a moderate increase in GSI), the large decrease in anxiety sensitivity and bodily fear, stable dysfunctional attitudes, and absence of strong rises in general psychopathology suggest no new disorder emerged between T1 and T2."
0,"The person began at T1 with lower positive mental health and life satisfaction, low self-efficacy, but also low stress, low psychopathology, and low fear/anxiety indicators—overall presenting as psychologically healthy. Between T1 and T2, key protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) all improved, risk factors like dysfunctional attitudes decreased, and while general psychopathology rose slightly, it remained low; thus, there is no evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there was a sharp decline in life satisfaction and an increase in dysfunctional attitudes, initial protective factors (high socioeconomic status, strong social support, high life satisfaction, and low stress) were prominent, and the final psychopathology (GSI) showed minimal change, suggesting no clear onset of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The person began with several risk factors (low socioeconomic status, below-average self-efficacy, low social support, high dysfunctional attitudes) and, between T1 and T2, experienced further declines in social support and positive mental health, increased dysfunctional attitudes, and a substantial rise in general psychopathology, all suggesting the development of a new psychological disorder by T2."
0,"Although there is a significant increase in general psychopathology and a moderate increase in fear of bodily sensations, the person began with low psychopathology, high self-efficacy, and low dysfunctional attitudes at T1, with improvements in positive mental health and life satisfaction by T2. The overall risk profile does not suggest a transition from health to a full psychological disorder within this interval."
0,"Although there is an increase in anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology at T2, the individual started with strong protective factors (low psychopathology, high life satisfaction and social support, low anxiety/fear, and below-average dysfunctional attitudes) and notably improved in positive mental health and self-efficacy at T2. The overall risk profile remains low, indicating no new psychological disorder developed between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there is a notable increase in general psychopathology (GSI), initial mental health at T1 was healthy (low GSI, good self-efficacy, average social support, low anxiety sensitivity), and protective factors such as social support and life satisfaction substantially improved by T2. No single risk factor increase is sufficient in magnitude or direction to indicate new disorder onset; instead, the combination of strong protective factors and lack of high baseline or spike in risk factors suggests no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The individual started with moderate psychological risk at T1 (low socioeconomic status, low self-efficacy, high stress, and above-average GSI), but showed substantial improvements across T1 to T2 in protective factors (notably large increases in positive mental health and social support, and reductions in general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations), suggesting resilience and reduced risk for developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite initial demographic and baseline psychological risk factors (low socioeconomic status, education, BMI, and low T1 mental health), all key protective variables (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) improve markedly from T1 to T2, and general psychopathology decreases, indicating the person did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite significant declines in protective factors such as positive mental health, self-efficacy, and social support, risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations decreased substantially, and general psychopathology, while increased, remains below average; combined with high socioeconomic status and low initial psychopathology, there is not enough evidence of a new psychological disorder developing."
0,"Despite average demographics and a very healthy psychological baseline at T1 (strong positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction, and low stress/psychopathology), the large drops in positive mental health, social support, and especially life satisfaction at T2 do not coincide with a meaningful rise in general psychopathology (GSI) or dysfunctional attitudes, and anxiety sensitivity actually decreases; thus, evidence for the emergence of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2 is lacking."
0,"The individual starts with strong protective factors (high education, socioeconomic status, positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and adaptive coping), despite high initial anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations. Over time, risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear, dysfunctional attitudes) decrease notably, and although there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and a drop in some protective factors, the overall pattern lacks the magnitude of deterioration or emergence of new risk factors necessary for a new disorder development."
0,"Despite significant decreases in protective factors such as positive mental health and self-efficacy, this individual starts with high psychological distress and several risk factors at T1 (elevated GSI, very low social support and life satisfaction, high dysfunctional attitudes) indicating existing difficulties or ongoing disorder rather than developing a new one; additionally, GSI and dysfunctional attitudes slightly decrease, reducing the likelihood of new disorder emergence."
0,"The individual had high positive mental health and adequate social support at T1, despite low life satisfaction, elevated stress, and moderately high general psychopathology. From T1 to T2, there were no significant increases in key risk factors or in psychopathology, and some risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) actually decreased; therefore, there is insufficient evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The person starts T1 with high positive mental health but also exhibits significant risk factors: low socioeconomic status, high stress, low self-efficacy and life satisfaction, and elevated anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology. Between T1 and T2, there are substantial declines in protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) and increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, general psychopathology), indicating the new development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite very low baseline protective factors at T1 (notably low social support, self-efficacy, coping skills, and life satisfaction), all major protective factors show dramatic improvement at T2 (especially social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction), while risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes) decrease sharply. Although there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology, the substantial gains in major protective factors indicate resilience, making new-onset psychological disorder development unlikely."
0,"Despite substantial decreases in positive mental health and social support, the individual already exhibited significant psychological distress and low protective factors at T1, suggesting ongoing mental health challenges rather than the onset of a new disorder between T1 and T2. There is no notable increase in general psychopathology from T1 to T2, indicating no new disorder likely developed during this period."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and some T1 risk factors (very low social support, low self-efficacy, high psychopathology), major protective factors (very high positive mental health, low stress, effective coping) were present at T1, and overall psychological distress (GSI) actually decreased from T1 to T2 alongside improvements in life satisfaction and social support, making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"Despite initially high stress and extremely low self-efficacy at T1, the person began with low risk (low psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, fear, and dysfunctional attitudes) and improved markedly in positive mental health and self-efficacy by T2; while GSI increased moderately and life satisfaction dropped, the overall risk profile and trajectory do not strongly support the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Although initial risk was somewhat elevated due to low socioeconomic status and poor positive mental health at T1, there were substantial increases in general psychopathology (GSI), fear of bodily sensations, anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes from T1 to T2, all strong indicators for the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, social support, problem-focused coping, low stress, low GSI, and low dysfunctional attitudes) and showed only mild increases in risk factors over time. Positive mental health, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy actually improved between T1 and T2, with only small elevations in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes, making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"Although this person had several risk factors at T1 (such as low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, high dysfunctional attitudes, and high fear/anxiety sensitivity), there were substantial positive changes from T1 to T2—including increased positive mental health, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and decreased dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology—indicating improvement rather than development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person already exhibited significant psychological distress and low protective factors at T1 (high GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, extremely low life satisfaction, low self-efficacy, low social support), indicating the likely presence of a psychological disorder at baseline; thus, their case represents ongoing disorder rather than the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there is a notable increase in general psychopathology (GSI) at T2, the person’s positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction all substantially improve, while risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes decrease; these protective changes suggest resilience and do not fit the profile of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with low risk (very low psychopathology, low anxiety sensitivity, high coping, and low dysfunctional attitudes, despite low SES and social support) and showed strong improvements between T1 and T2 in all major protective factors, including large increases in social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and positive mental health, as well as a marked decline in dysfunctional attitudes; while GSI rose modestly, the overall shift clearly points toward improved psychological health rather than new disorder development."
0,"The individual had strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low psychopathology), and although there were substantial declines in self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction, and an increase in general psychopathology by T2, there is no clear evidence that they transitioned from a healthy baseline to developing a new psychological disorder; the initial protective baseline and only moderate risk elevation suggest ongoing resilience or subclinical change rather than disorder onset."
0,"The person already displayed elevated risk factors and mild symptoms at T1 (notably high anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), indicating possible ongoing or prodromal disorder; although some risk factors increased slightly at T2, protective factors like positive mental health and life satisfaction also improved, and GSI change is minimal, suggesting no clear emergence of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although the individual showed significant psychological distress and risk factors at T1, they experienced marked improvements in protective factors (e.g., large increases in self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction) and large decreases in risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, general psychopathology) by T2, suggesting recovery rather than the development of a new disorder."
0,"The person showed severe psychological distress and elevated risk factors at T1, indicating likely pre-existing psychopathology rather than new-onset disorder. By T2, core risk factors (GSI, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations) actually decreased and protective factors (self-efficacy, positive mental health, life satisfaction) increased, suggesting improvement or ongoing disorder rather than the emergence of a new one."
0,"Despite notable declines in positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction—and a lower socioeconomic status—there is no increase in overall psychopathology (GSI decreases), anxiety sensitivity only moderately increases, and some risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations) actually decrease; combined with a healthy T1 baseline, these changes do not indicate the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual already exhibited multiple and severe psychological risk factors—including high psychopathology (GSI), elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, low social support, low self-efficacy, and low life satisfaction—at T1, indicating an existing psychological disorder; while many factors worsened by T2, there is no evidence they transitioned from a healthy state to disorder between T1 and T2, but rather that they had ongoing issues."
0,"Although the person had significant risk at T1 (high stress, high psychopathology, low SES, and education), these risks were present from the start and actually improved by T2. Key protective factors (positive mental health, coping skills) remained strong, life satisfaction increased markedly, and general psychopathology decreased dramatically, indicating either recovery or ongoing adjustment without new disorder development."
0,"Although this person had multiple risk factors at T1 (low socioeconomic status, low social support, low self-efficacy, and low life satisfaction), they experienced significant improvements in key protective factors (notably large increases in social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) from T1 to T2, alongside only a moderate rise in general psychopathology that does not clearly indicate onset of a new disorder. The overall pattern suggests recovery or resilience rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with an exceptionally strong protective profile at T1 (very high self-efficacy, coping, social support, and low psychopathology), and although some risk factors slightly increased (notably a rise in dysfunctional attitudes and GSI), their overall psychological distress and key risk factors remain well below average, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"The individual began with strong protective factors, including high life satisfaction, low stress, low general psychopathology, and strong social support; these further improved or remained stable over time. Despite a modest increase in general psychopathology, risk factors remained low or decreased, and protective factors markedly increased (higher positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction), making development of a new disorder unlikely."
0,"The individual began with some risk factors at T1, such as low social support, below-average life satisfaction, and mildly elevated anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, but also had nearly average mental health and low general psychopathology. From T1 to T2, there were substantial improvements in protective factors (big increases in life satisfaction, social support, and self-efficacy) and reductions in risk (marked declines in anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and no meaningful rise in general psychopathology), indicating no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite very high baseline risk (high GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, poor social support, low SES/education), there is an extremely large decrease in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes from T1 to T2, with substantial reduction in risk factors (GSI: -6.7, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations all strongly decreased) and improvements in protective factors (large increases in social support and self-efficacy). This pattern suggests remission or recovery, not new onset disorder."
0,"Despite a poor baseline at T1 with low positive mental health, low life satisfaction, high dysfunctional attitudes, and low self-efficacy, the individual does not show increases in general psychopathology at T2; improvements are evident in social support and self-efficacy, while distress and GSI even decrease—overall, this pattern does not support new disorder onset."
1,"Although the person had above-average protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy) and low distress at T1, T2 saw large, negative changes in all protective factors accompanied by sharply increased psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, and fear of bodily sensations—indicating the new development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual had generally good mental health at T1, with robust self-efficacy, adequate social support, and low dysfunctional attitudes, and although positive mental health decreased and general psychopathology increased slightly over time, key risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations actually decreased. There is no strong evidence of a new psychological disorder developing between T1 and T2 given the stability or improvement of several protective factors and only mild worsening of distress."
0,"The individual already exhibited severe psychopathology and elevated risk factors at T1, indicating an existing psychological disorder; while there are some worsening (e.g., fear of bodily sensations) and some improvements (especially the strong reduction in general psychopathology), there is no evidence of new disorder onset between T1 and T2."
1,"Although the person started with low positive mental health, life satisfaction, and moderate stress at T1, they experienced substantial increases in general psychopathology (GSI), dysfunctional attitudes, and a sharp decline in life satisfaction at T2, suggesting the onset of a new psychological disorder despite some improvements in protective factors such as positive mental health, self-efficacy, and reduced fear of bodily sensations."
0,"The individual began with predominantly average or slightly protective factors at T1, with only modest vulnerability (some low self-efficacy and life satisfaction). From T1 to T2, most risk factors (e.g., dysfunctional attitudes, GSI, anxiety sensitivity) actually decreased or remained stable, and though protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy) declined, there is no marked increase in psychopathology or emergence of strong risk, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Despite a marked decrease in positive mental health from T1 to T2, other key risk factors—such as general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes—all decreased substantially, and several protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) increased. This pattern suggests significant overall improvement and does not indicate the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there was a substantial increase in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, there were even stronger and positive increases in protective factors including positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; general psychopathology only increased minimally, suggesting overall improved adjustment and no clear development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with good positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction, and low psychopathology, but extremely low self-efficacy (a risk factor). Despite notable declines in positive mental health and social support between T1 and T2, there is not a large enough increase in general psychopathology or risk factors to indicate onset of a new psychological disorder; most scores remain within the non-clinical range, and the slight increase in self-efficacy at T2 may be protective."
0,"Despite some demographic risk factors, the person starts with very high positive mental health, high life satisfaction, and low psychopathology, all strong protective factors. Over time, most changes are either protective (e.g., large increase in social support, improvements in self-efficacy, decreases in fear of bodily sensations and general psychopathology), and there are no substantial increases in key risk factors."
0,"Although this person experienced a significant drop in positive mental health and has ongoing low social support and life satisfaction, risk factors like dysfunctional attitudes, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology all decrease between T1 and T2, and protective factors like self-efficacy and social support improve. There is no evidence of new onset of psychological disorder—instead, the overall psychological profile appears stable or even improved between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite some increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, the individual started with very strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction, low dysfunctional attitudes and low psychopathology), and most risk factors either improved or remained low; the overall pattern does not indicate the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started with numerous risk factors at T1 (low mental health, low social support, low self-efficacy, poor coping skills) but also low psychopathology and anxiety, suggesting enduring subclinical or ongoing difficulties rather than new-onset disorder. Although life satisfaction and positive mental health decreased further and GSI increased slightly, there is no indication of a clear, substantial shift from health to disorder status between T1 and T2; rather, baseline functioning was already poor."
0,"The person started with strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction, low psychopathology, and low dysfunctional attitudes) and showed overall stability or improvements in positive mental health and life satisfaction at T2, with only modest increases in risk factors and no sharp rise in general psychopathology, indicating no development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Despite initial protective factors at T1 (high positive mental health and social support), this individual exhibited pronounced increases in key risk factors between T1 and T2—specifically, dramatic rises in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, declining social support and self-efficacy, and moderately increased general psychopathology—indicating the likely onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this individual had significant risk factors at T1 (high dysfunctional attitudes, low life satisfaction, high stress, high emotion-focused coping, high anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), they did not show a marked increase in general psychopathology at T2. Most protective and risk factors worsened, but general psychopathology remained below average and did not move into a range suggesting the new onset of a psychological disorder; instead, this profile indicates ongoing subclinical difficulties or chronic risk without clear disorder development."
0,"Although there is a marked decline in positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, and a significant increase in dysfunctional attitudes, baseline psychopathology at T1 was essentially average and the increase in general psychopathology (GSI) is negligible, suggesting that the individual did not cross the threshold into a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual shows improvements or stability across most psychological variables: increases in positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support, and decreases in dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology. Despite having lower education and some baseline risk factors (stress and dysfunctional attitudes at T1), the overall trajectory and T2 profile do not suggest the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual started with low socioeconomic status, low education, and multiple risk factors at T1 (low life satisfaction, high stress, low coping, and slightly elevated dysfunctional attitudes), their T2 changes indicate improvements across nearly all protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and a decrease in anxiety sensitivity. There is a moderate increase in dysfunctional attitudes and a slight increase in GSI, but these do not outweigh the broad improvements and the absence of marked worsening in psychopathology, suggesting the person did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person had some risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low self-efficacy, high stress), but strong protective factors (high social support, low psychopathology, very low dysfunctional attitudes) and showed substantial improvements in key protective factors (self-efficacy and positive mental health increased, stress did not increase, GSI and dysfunctional attitudes remained low), supporting no new disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and multiple risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low social support, higher anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes), T2 shows improvements in several protective factors (large increases in social support, self-efficacy, positive mental health, and reduced anxiety sensitivity, with only minimal GSI increase), indicating no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The individual exhibited robust protective factors at T1—including high self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction, alongside low psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes—while only minor increases in risk factors and a moderate rise in general psychopathology occurred at T2, insufficient to suggest new disorder onset given the overwhelmingly positive baseline and persisting strengths."
0,"The individual had strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and low stress), and though dysfunctional attitudes rose substantially by T2, key risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology remained stable or improved slightly. There is no clear evidence of new disorder development, as general psychopathology (GSI) increased only minimally and remained close to average."
0,"Despite a low socioeconomic status and some decreases in protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction, and social support), the person had strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, coping, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with low stress and psychopathology), and changes toward risk between T1 and T2 are modest; the GSI increase is small to moderate but not enough in magnitude or in combination with other risk factors to indicate likely new disorder development."
0,"The individual started with relatively low risk—low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, and very low anxiety sensitivity/fear, despite low positive mental health and coping. Between T1 and T2, key protective factors (positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction) increased substantially, and although general psychopathology and some risk factors increased slightly, the changes do not reach a magnitude suggesting new disorder onset."
0,"The individual started with moderate risk (low positive mental health, low life satisfaction, high fear of bodily sensations), but no evidence of high psychopathology or a new disorder at T2 appears—protective factors such as social support and problem-focused coping were initially strong, and although some risk factors worsened (decline in self-efficacy and social support), major risk indicators (GSI, dysfunctional attitudes) did not meaningfully increase, and general psychopathology actually decreased, suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Despite a baseline profile of good social support, self-efficacy, and low psychopathology at T1, this individual shows a dramatic increase in general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and significant loss of self-efficacy by T2—strongly suggesting the onset of a psychological disorder."
0,"Although this person begins with several risk factors at T1 (low social support, low life satisfaction, low socioeconomic status, elevated GSI, and dysfunctional attitudes), their mental health, social support, and self-efficacy all improve substantially between T1 and T2, with a notable decrease in general psychopathology, indicating recovery or stability rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite lower education and BMI, the individual started with below-average positive mental health and social support, but showed notable improvements from T1 to T2 in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, while risk factors like dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety-related measures decreased or remained stable, and psychopathology stayed very low—indicating no new psychological disorder development."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and some baseline risk factors (e.g., low positive mental health, high dysfunctional attitudes), T2 shows improved protective factors—sharp increases in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, alongside decreases in key risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity). While social support declines, the overall shifts suggest reduced risk for new disorder development."
0,"At T1, the person showed strong protective factors (high education, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; low anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology), with only minimal increases in risk factors between T1 and T2 (moderate rises in anxiety sensitivity, fear, and dysfunctional attitudes, but all still likely below or near average). These changes are not of sufficient magnitude or direction to support the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual had some risk factors at T1 (notably low education, high stress, high dysfunctional attitudes, and a high GSI indicating existing psychological symptoms), these problems were already present at baseline (suggesting an ongoing disorder). Between T1 and T2, most risk factors and symptoms (positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support, fear of bodily sensations, and GSI) decreased, but because the person was already unwell at T1, this pattern does not indicate the development of a new disorder between time points."
0,"While the person has relatively low demographic protective factors (lower education, BMI, and socioeconomic status) and a marked decrease in social support and life satisfaction from T1 to T2, their T1 baseline mental health is very strong (low stress, high life satisfaction and social support, very low anxiety and fear, low GSI), and changes in psychopathology and risk factors are only modest. Thus, this pattern suggests resilience rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although this individual had low baseline protective factors (e.g., low social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction), high stress, and high dysfunctional attitudes at T1 (all of which are risk factors), these suggest likely pre-existing psychological difficulties or a disorder already present at T1. There is significant positive change in positive mental health and life satisfaction by T2 and a decrease in dysfunctional attitudes, despite increases in certain risk factors and GSI. The pattern is most consistent with ongoing/recovering psychological difficulties rather than the clear onset of a new disorder after an initially healthy baseline."
0,"Despite low education (a risk factor), this person started T1 with very strong protective factors—high social support, self-efficacy, extremely high life satisfaction, low stress, and low psychopathology. Although there was some reduction in protective factors at T2 (notably reduced social support and life satisfaction) and a mild increase in general psychopathology, their overall baseline was highly resilient and there is no strong indication that a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Although this individual began with high risk factors at T1 (notably high general psychopathology, dysfunctional attitudes, stress, and coping; low self-efficacy; average-to-low education), these values indicate an ongoing psychological disorder or high distress present already at T1, not a new disorder developed between T1 and T2. Thus, there is no evidence of a transition from health to disorder during the time period in question."
0,"The individual had significant psychological distress and anxiety-related risk factors already at T1 (high GSI, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations), indicating an existing disorder rather than the development of a new one; although some risk factors increased further, overall psychopathology actually decreased, suggesting ongoing psychological difficulties rather than the emergence of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual had no major psychological risk factors at T1 (low distress, high self-efficacy, high social support, and low GSI), and although there was a decline in self-efficacy and life satisfaction with a mild increase in overall psychopathology, protective factors remained relatively strong and there were no substantial increases in core risk factors or GSI that would indicate the onset of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The person began with multiple risk factors at T1 (low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, low socioeconomic status), but experienced strong negative changes between T1 and T2: dramatic decreases in social support and self-efficacy, sharply increased general psychopathology (GSI), and marked increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, all indicating the likely development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The person already demonstrated severe psychopathology and high distress at T1 (extremely elevated GSI, high stress, low life satisfaction, strong dysfunctional attitudes), indicating the presence of an ongoing psychological disorder. Substantial improvements by T2 (large decreases in GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, and markedly increased life satisfaction and social support) suggest recovery or continued disorder, not new onset."
0,"Although the individual had significant risk factors at T1 (very low self-efficacy, high stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), their general psychopathology was below average and did not increase dramatically; in T2, there were improvements in self-efficacy and anxiety sensitivity, and increased life satisfaction. Despite reduced social support and positive mental health, there’s no strong evidence of a new psychological disorder developing, as risk factors decreased and core symptoms of psychopathology remain moderate."
0,"Despite initially elevated risk factors at T1 (notably high anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and fear of bodily sensations), the individual showed substantial increases in positive mental health and reductions in anxiety sensitivity by T2, with only modest rises in general psychopathology. There is no clear pattern of new disorder emergence, but rather evidence of improved psychological resilience and protection against disorder development."
0,"Although this individual had several risk factors at T1 (low social support, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, high anxiety sensitivity, high dysfunctional attitudes, and elevated general psychopathology), there was a marked improvement in general psychopathology between T1 and T2, and no substantial increases in other risk factors—indicating recovery or stable ongoing difficulties, but no emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual starts with high socioeconomic status, strong protective factors (very high positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and coping), and although there are elevated risk factors at T1 (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and GSI), these all markedly decrease by T2, with further increases in protective factors (notably, life satisfaction rises), suggesting recovery or ongoing issues rather than the new development of a disorder."
0,"Despite a dramatic drop in positive mental health between T1 and T2, the individual actually experienced major improvements in social support, life satisfaction, and decreases in general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations, all of which are strong protective factors. There is no evidence of increasing risk factors or psychopathology that would support the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person had strong protective factors at T1, including very high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low anxiety sensitivity. Although positive mental health was below average and general psychopathology increased somewhat by T2, there were no substantial increases in key risk factors nor losses in major protective factors that suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual began with somewhat low positive mental health and self-efficacy but reasonable protective factors (high life satisfaction, social support, low psychopathology). However, from T1 to T2, there is a marked increase in general psychopathology, a significant decline in life satisfaction and self-efficacy, alongside increased fear of bodily sensations and dysfunctional attitudes, collectively supporting the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there is a strong increase in dysfunctional attitudes and some decline in positive mental health and self-efficacy, the initial baseline is highly resilient (very high self-efficacy, low psychopathology, strong social support, and low anxiety sensitivity), and there is no increase in general psychopathology; overall, risk factors remain low enough that a new disorder development is unlikely."
0,"Despite a substantial increase in dysfunctional attitudes, the person started with low risk (very low dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations, and average general psychopathology) and showed stable or even improved life satisfaction and positive mental health over time; general psychopathology remained low, indicating no development of a psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual started with strong protective factors (very high self-efficacy, high life satisfaction, high social support, low dysfunctional attitudes, and high SES) and only mild risk factors, but experienced a substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and a sharp decrease in self-efficacy between T1 and T2, indicating the likely onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual already displayed severe psychological distress at T1 (very high GSI, dysfunctional attitudes, low self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and social support), indicating an ongoing disorder; although there is some improvement (increased positive mental health and social support, decreased GSI), there is no evidence of new disorder onset between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual started with low positive mental health, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy, but also had low stress, low anxiety sensitivity, and low general psychopathology at T1, suggesting no initial disorder. Across T1 to T2, protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction, self-efficacy) markedly improved, risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) decreased or remained low overall, and psychopathology (GSI) remained low—together indicating no development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status and education (risk factors), the person started with highly protective factors (very high positive mental health and general self-efficacy, good life satisfaction, and low psychopathology), and though there was a marked decline in positive mental health and self-efficacy, social support and life satisfaction increased, dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology did not worsen, suggesting no clear evidence for new disorder development."
0,"Despite some decreases in protective factors (positive mental health, general self-efficacy, life satisfaction) and enduring high dysfunctional attitudes, there is no meaningful increase in key risk factors (global psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, or fear) from T1 to T2, and in fact psychopathology slightly decreases. Thus, there is no clear evidence of the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"This person already displayed severe psychological distress and likely an ongoing disorder at T1 (very high GSI, highly dysfunctional attitudes, very low self-efficacy, poor coping and life satisfaction), meaning any changes observed by T2 do not represent the onset of a new disorder but rather fluctuations or worsening of an existing one."
0,"Although the individual had some risk factors at T1, such as high stress, elevated psychopathology, and low self-efficacy, their T1 positive mental health and life satisfaction were strong protective factors. Between T1 and T2, key risk indicators—general psychopathology, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes—substantially decreased, while protective factors such as social support and general self-efficacy increased, making it unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The person started with strong protective demographic factors (high education, high socioeconomic status) and only mildly negative psychological variables at T1 (slightly lower positive mental health and self-efficacy, but low stress, adequate coping, low psychopathology). Between T1 and T2, most risk factors decreased (e.g., lower anxiety sensitivity, GSI decreased), and although there were some reductions in social support and life satisfaction, there is no evidence of a newly emerging disorder given the overall pattern of stable or improving risk variables and continued protective factors."
0,"The individual was healthy at T1, demonstrating robust protective factors such as high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with low overall psychopathology and risk factors. Although there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology and dysfunctional attitudes by T2, protective factors remain relatively strong, there are gains in positive mental health and social support, and there are no clear indications of a new psychological disorder developing."
0,"At T1 the individual already shows elevated psychopathology, stress, and risk factors indicative of an existing disorder; between T1 and T2, key risk factors and general psychopathology actually decrease, with no evidence of new-onset difficulties—thus, there is no indication of a new psychological disorder developing in this period."
0,"Despite high initial risk factors (very elevated anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology at T1), these dramatically decreased by T2, accompanied by gains in life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and especially social support. This improving pattern of both risk and protective factors suggests the individual likely did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"Although this person showed strong protective factors and low risk at T1 (e.g., high life satisfaction, self-efficacy, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes), the substantial increases in risk factors between T1 and T2—including dramatically higher anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology—strongly suggest the onset of a new psychological disorder at T2."
0,"The individual already displayed very high general psychopathology (GSI) at T1, indicating an existing psychological disorder, and although some risk factors increased and protective factors decreased further at T2, there is no evidence that a new disorder developed—rather, the data support persistence or worsening of ongoing psychopathology."
0,"The individual presents several risk factors at T1, such as high stress, low social support, low life satisfaction, and low self-efficacy, but their GSI is below average (indicating low general psychopathology), and there is no marked increase in GSI from T1 to T2. Despite the decrease in positive mental health and social support, there are also improvements—such as a substantial rise in life satisfaction and a decrease in dysfunctional attitudes—suggesting the individual did not develop a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The person showed low positive mental health and self-efficacy at T1 but was relatively low in stress and psychopathology, suggesting no disorder at baseline. Substantial increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology from T1 to T2, along with only weak or negative changes in protective factors, indicate the likely development of a psychological disorder by T2."
0,"The person began with moderate mental health and strong protective factors (notably high social support, self-efficacy, and low stress). Although there was a decline in social support and positive mental health, risk factors (like GSI, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations) decreased, indicating improved mental health and no evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started psychologically healthy at T1, with high protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction, low psychopathology, low anxiety sensitivity/fear, low dysfunctional attitudes) despite slightly low self-efficacy and low socioeconomic status. From T1 to T2, risk factors did not increase meaningfully, and several protective factors either remained stable or improved, with a notable decrease in general psychopathology, so there is no indication of new disorder development."
0,"Despite low education as a potential demographic risk factor and an already below-average positive mental health at T1, the individual showed very strong protective factors at baseline (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress, low general psychopathology), and no significant increase in risk factors or psychopathology at T2. The modest increase in general psychopathology at T2 is not of sufficient magnitude to suggest disorder onset, especially since key risk variables and overall adaptation remain stable or even slightly improved."
0,"The individual demonstrates strong protective factors at T1, including high positive mental health, social support, and adaptive coping, and while self-efficacy is low, risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes are minimal. From T1 to T2, most variables either improve or remain stable (notably, psychopathology significantly decreases and dysfunctional attitudes drop), making it unlikely that a new psychological disorder developed."
0,"The individual already exhibited very high psychological distress (GSI = 2.67) at T1, indicating an ongoing psychological disorder; while several risk factors worsened (e.g., further reduced self-efficacy, increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear), and some protective factors declined, this does not represent the onset of a new disorder, but rather the continuation or exacerbation of existing psychopathology."
0,"Despite some demographic risk (lower socioeconomic status), this individual started with a psychologically healthy baseline at T1—strong social support, low risk factors, and low psychopathology. At T2, protective factors (like life satisfaction) increased or remained stable, risk factors stayed low or improved, and overall general psychopathology decreased, suggesting no new disorder development."
0,"The individual started out with overall healthy psychological functioning (high positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and low distress), with some vulnerability indicated by elevated anxiety sensitivity and low life satisfaction. However, from T1 to T2, key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, psychopathology) decreased and major protective factors (life satisfaction, self-efficacy) increased or remained stable, and there is no evidence of increased general psychopathology, suggesting they did not develop a new psychological disorder."
1,"Despite a strong protective factor of high socioeconomic status and low baseline psychological distress at T1, this individual demonstrated large increases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and overall psychopathology between T1 and T2—indicating a likely development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person already exhibited high risk for a psychological disorder at T1 (elevated GSI, stress, dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, low life satisfaction, and poor social support), implying they likely had an existing disorder. Despite improvements in many psychological variables (notable drops in dysfunctional attitudes, anxiety sensitivity, and increased life satisfaction and support), general psychopathology increased further, suggesting persistence or fluctuation of problems rather than the emergence of a new disorder."
1,"Although there were improvements in positive mental health and social support, the person began with multiple risk factors (high baseline anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, low self-efficacy, and high stress), and between T1 and T2 there was a marked increase in general psychopathology (GSI) and anxiety sensitivity—suggesting the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person had strong protective factors and good mental health at T1, with improvements or stability in most areas and a significant decrease in general psychopathology by T2, indicating no new psychological disorder emerged."
0,"The person already showed very high general psychopathology and several significant risk factors at T1, indicating an existing psychological disorder; although some symptoms and risk factors improved by T2, there is no evidence of developing a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although protective factors such as positive mental health and social support decrease substantially and general psychopathology (GSI) rises notably, the individual started with very strong mental health, high social support, low psychopathology, and low dysfunction at T1. There is no evidence that the changes reflect a transition from healthy to disordered at T2, as baseline levels were highly positive and risk factor changes do not reach a threshold strongly indicative of a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual was psychologically healthy at T1, but experienced large increases in general psychopathology (GSI) and substantial decreases in protective factors such as positive mental health, self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction between T1 and T2, indicating the development of a psychological disorder."
0,"The individual already had several protective factors (high self-efficacy, social support, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes) and low risk at T1, and from T1 to T2, even though dysfunctional attitudes increased, other risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations) markedly decreased, key protective factors (life satisfaction, positive mental health, self-efficacy) improved, and overall psychopathology decreased, making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"Although baseline risk factors were high (notably very high general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, low positive mental health and social support), all key psychopathology and risk indicators substantially decreased by T2 (notable drops in GSI, anxiety sensitivity, fear, and dysfunctional attitudes), while social support and positive mental health improved; thus, there is strong evidence of symptom reduction or recovery rather than new disorder onset."
0,"The person started with some psychological vulnerabilities at T1 (notably low positive mental health and moderate stress) but also had strong protective factors (high social support, high self-efficacy, low dysfunctional attitudes, and low psychopathology). Despite a decline in several protective factors and an increase in general psychopathology over time, there is no clear pattern of new and significant risk factor elevation that would strongly indicate the emergence of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
1,"The individual started with multiple risk factors at T1 (notably low self-efficacy, low positive mental health, low social support, high dysfunctional attitudes, and above-average psychopathology), and experienced further decreases in life satisfaction and social support along with increased dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology at T2, supporting the likelihood of developing a psychological disorder during the interval."
0,"The individual showed strong protective factors at T1, including high self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction, and very low stress and psychopathology. Despite a substantial decrease in positive mental health, most risk factors remained low or further decreased, and GSI showed virtually no increase—indicating no development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status, the individual had strong protective factors at T1 (high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, and low stress and dysfunctional attitudes) and showed further reductions in most risk factors and psychopathology from T1 to T2, with no significant increase in risk variables—indicating they did not develop a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual starts with significant protective factors at T1 (high social support, high self-efficacy, low stress, active problem-focused coping, low general psychopathology) despite some demographic risk factors and low positive mental health. Most key risk and protective factors remain stable or improve between T1 and T2, with no meaningful increase in psychopathology or risk factors, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Despite low socioeconomic status (a risk factor), the individual started with strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, and low stress or psychopathology). Although there were notable declines in self-efficacy and life satisfaction and some increases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, there is no substantial elevation in overall psychopathology or a pattern strongly indicating the emergence of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there are significant risk factors such as low socioeconomic status, low self-efficacy, ongoing dysfunctional attitudes at T1, and a strong drop in life satisfaction and positive mental health by T2, there is also a substantial gain in social support and self-efficacy, and only a very minimal change in general psychopathology (GSI). The overall pattern suggests increased vulnerability but not a sufficient shift towards new disorder development."
0,"The individual began with several protective factors (high socioeconomic status, low anxiety sensitivity, low dysfunctional attitudes, low general psychopathology) and, despite some decreases in positive mental health and life satisfaction, did not show substantial increases in risk factors or general psychopathology at T2; in fact, their overall psychological distress decreased, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Despite an increase in dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity, the person already showed significant psychological symptoms and high general psychopathology at T1, indicating the likely presence of an existing disorder. The marked decrease in psychopathology (GSI) at T2 actually suggests improvement, not the development of a new disorder."
0,"The individual already exhibited clear signs of a psychological disorder at T1, shown by high general psychopathology (GSI), extremely low self-efficacy, high dysfunctional attitudes, very low life satisfaction, and low social support. The further increases in risk factors at T2 reflect either disorder maintenance or worsening, not the development of a new disorder from a healthy baseline."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1—including high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, as well as low stress and psychopathology—and although there were increases in certain risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI), the baseline resilience and only moderate changes suggest the absence of new clinical disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there were some risk factors at T1 (high stress, emotion-focused coping, and dysfunctional attitudes), protective factors such as social support and self-efficacy were average, and general psychopathology remained below average. No meaningful increases in general psychopathology or onset of key risk symptoms between T1 and T2 were detected, making the development of a new psychological disorder unlikely."
0,"Despite an abrupt decrease in positive mental health, this person’s protective factors (strong increases in life satisfaction and social support, with low or stable psychopathology and declining dysfunctional attitudes) outweigh risk; there is no compelling evidence for new disorder development between T1 and T2."
0,"Although this person had notable risk factors at T1 (elevated anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, average general psychopathology), the general psychopathology (GSI) actually decreased from T1 to T2, and no substantial new overall distress was indicated despite marked increases in dysfunctional attitudes and anxiety sensitivity. The sharp drop in life satisfaction and self-efficacy point to vulnerability, but there is insufficient evidence of new psychological disorder onset given these mixed and somewhat ambivalent trends."
1,"Despite some protective factors at T1 (e.g., high life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support), there is a large increase in general psychopathology (GSI), a dramatic drop in life satisfaction, and a notable rise in dysfunctional attitudes between T1 and T2, together strongly indicating the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with strong protective factors at T1 (high education, positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, plus low stress and psychopathology), and although some protective factors declined and GSI increased at T2, risk factors remained low or even decreased; there is no strong evidence of new disorder development."
0,"Although the person started with multiple risk factors at T1—including low positive mental health, high stress, high anxiety sensitivity, high fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and elevated psychopathology—their psychological state markedly improved by T2 (large reductions in risk factors, higher positive mental health, and lower general psychopathology), indicating recovery rather than new disorder development."
0,"Although general psychopathology (GSI) moderately increased from T1 to T2, this individual started with low risk at baseline (low dysfunction, low psychopathology, high protective coping), and most risk factors—such as anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes—substantially decreased over time, while protective factors like positive mental health and self-efficacy improved. The marked drop in life satisfaction does not outweigh the overall reduction in core risk factors, making new disorder onset unlikely."
0,"Despite high initial risk factors (elevated stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and GSI at T1) and socioeconomic disadvantages, there are strong protective factors at play—namely, large gains in positive mental health and life satisfaction, alongside decreases in dysfunctional attitudes and fear of bodily sensations—suggesting recovery or stability rather than the new onset of a psychological disorder at T2."
0,"Despite the significant drop in positive mental health and rise in some risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, general psychopathology), the person started with high positive mental health, very low stress, and low general psychopathology at T1, and there is also a strong increase in life satisfaction and social support by T2. These protective factors are likely sufficient to prevent the development of a new psychological disorder, even amidst some increased risk."
0,"Although there is a marked decrease in positive mental health and general self-efficacy and a moderate increase in general psychopathology, the person started with above-average protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support) and low psychological distress. The increases in risk factors are not sufficiently severe or pervasive to strongly indicate the development of a new psychological disorder, especially since life satisfaction increases and most risk factors remain moderate."
0,"The individual started with some risk factors (low education, higher BMI, low social support and self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, high anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes), but their protective factors and risk factors significantly improved between T1 and T2 (increased positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and large decreases in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), with no marked increase in general psychopathology. This pattern suggests they did not develop a new psychological disorder."
1,"The individual started with already low protective factors (positive mental health, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support) and high stress, and then exhibited a dramatic increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, alongside rising anxiety sensitivity and further loss of social support—indicating the likely development of a psychological disorder at T2."
0,"Although the individual exhibited significant risk factors at T1, such as low positive mental health, low social support, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, and elevated psychopathology, all key protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, positive mental health) improved substantially by T2, and general psychopathology significantly decreased, indicating recovery rather than new disorder development."
0,"The individual started with strong protective factors at T1—very high self-efficacy, high social support, very low general psychopathology, anxiety sensitivity, and dysfunctional attitudes, despite lower positive mental health and life satisfaction. Although there is an increase in general psychopathology and an appreciable drop in self-efficacy from T1 to T2, life satisfaction and positive mental health improve and all major risk factors remain below average, suggesting no new disorder developed."
0,"The person started with average-to-good mental health, low stress, low general psychopathology, and some protective factors (life satisfaction, social support improving across time), while risk factors such as anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations remained moderate or declined. Importantly, protective factors increased at T2, dysfunctional attitudes dropped notably, and general psychopathology (GSI) decreased, indicating no development of a psychological disorder."
0,"Despite the low education (a risk factor) and a slight increase in general psychopathology, strong protective changes occurred between T1 and T2: positive mental health and life satisfaction improved significantly, and high baseline risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations) sharply decreased. The person started with low psychopathology and continues to show a pattern inconsistent with new disorder development."
0,"The person already had relatively good mental health at T1 with low stress and psychopathology, moderate-to-good social support, and low dysfunctional attitudes; T2 shows improvements in positive mental health, life satisfaction, and further decreases in risk factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and GSI). This pattern does not indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with multiple protective factors at T1 (high social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low stress, and low psychopathology), and although there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology, most risk factors remained low or decreased, while positive mental health markedly improved. The overall pattern suggests continued psychological health rather than new disorder development."
0,"Although the person had very low social support and self-efficacy at T1, their psychological risk factors did not worsen between T1 and T2, with GSI and most risk variables either improving or remaining stable, and protective factors (social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy) showing significant positive changes; this pattern does not indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person began with strong protective factors (high social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction; very low stress; low psychopathology and anxiety measures) and although there are slight increases in risk factors and a decrease in some protective factors at T2 (notably self-efficacy and life satisfaction), the general psychopathology increase is minimal, remaining in the non-clinical range, and no clear evidence suggests the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual began with multiple protective factors at T1 (low psychopathology, above-average self-efficacy, low dysfunctional attitudes, good coping), and although there are moderate increases in risk factors (e.g., GSI, anxiety sensitivity) between T1 and T2, strong increases in protective factors like self-efficacy and life satisfaction indicate overall resilience; there is no clear evidence of new disorder onset."
0,"The person started with strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, coping, and low dysfunctional attitudes and distress) and these generally improved or were maintained between T1 and T2, with only small increases in risk (GSI up slightly but still low, mild increase in anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes). There is no clear pattern or magnitude of worsening enough to suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with overall low risk (low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes, low anxiety sensitivity, low stress, despite low life satisfaction and positive mental health), and while some risk factors increased (notably fear of bodily sensations and dysfunctional attitudes), overall protective factors such as life satisfaction and positive mental health improved, and there was only a slight increase in general psychopathology—insufficient to support the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person started with generally good mental health aside from low positive mental health and problem-focused coping, and their protective factors (self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support) either remained high or improved at T2. Although there is a moderate increase in general psychopathology (GSI), there are no major deteriorations in risk factors or protective factors sufficient to suggest the emergence of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual showed severe psychological difficulties at T1 (high general psychopathology, extremely elevated anxiety sensitivity and fear, low self-efficacy, low social support and life satisfaction), but these risk factors and psychopathology markedly decreased by T2 (large drop in GSI, anxiety sensitivity, fear, and dysfunctional attitudes), indicating recovery or ongoing disorder rather than the development of a new disorder."
1,"The individual showed average to good mental health and protective factors at T1, but between T1 and T2 there were very large increases in major risk variables (GSI, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes), combined with sharp drops in protective factors (self-efficacy, life satisfaction), indicating the likely development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some demographic risk factors (lower education and SES), the individual had good mental health at T1 (low psychopathology, high social support, high life satisfaction, low distress). While general psychopathology increased slightly at T2, there was improvement or stability in most protective and risk factors (e.g., increased positive mental health, decreased dysfunctional attitudes), indicating no clear evidence of a new psychological disorder developing."
0,"Despite high baseline risk from low socioeconomic status, education, and life satisfaction, the individual started with very low risk profile at T1 (all protective mental health indicators were strong, risk factors low, and GSI was low), and demonstrated large improvements in most protective factors (mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction). While there was a notable increase in anxiety sensitivity and some increase in general psychopathology, the strong and broad improvements in key protective factors make new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Although the person had some elevated initial risk factors (notably high stress and low positive mental health at T1, coupled with low socioeconomic status), the protective factors (high self-efficacy and adequate coping skills) were strong, and changes from T1 to T2 indicate improvement or stability across risk domains—especially decreases in general psychopathology and anxiety sensitivity—suggesting no development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite an increase in some risk factors (anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), strong improvements in key protective factors (substantial increases in positive mental health, life satisfaction, general self-efficacy, social support), and generally high baseline socioeconomic status and BMI, suggest enhanced psychological resilience rather than disorder development. The slight increase in general psychopathology remains minor, and no major decline is observed in protective factors—overall, this pattern does not indicate the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"This individual started with strong protective factors (high life satisfaction, social support, low psychopathology, low dysfunctional attitudes) and only mild increases in risk factors over time (notably GSI, anxiety sensitivity), but overall positive mental health, life satisfaction, and absence of significant new or high-magnitude risk factors suggest that a new psychological disorder did not develop between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite low life satisfaction and self-efficacy at T1, the individual had strong protective factors (high social support, high socioeconomic status, and positive mental health). Although there was a moderate increase in dysfunctional attitudes and general psychopathology, there were significant protective changes (strong increase in life satisfaction, reduction in fear of bodily sensations), and risk levels remained moderate overall, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"The individual already exhibited significant psychological distress and a relatively high Global Severity Index (GSI) at T1, indicating the likely presence of a psychological disorder at baseline; while risk factors worsened substantially between T1 and T2 (notably in GSI, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and loss of protective factors like self-efficacy and life satisfaction), these changes represent either a continuation or exacerbation of an existing disorder rather than the development of a new one."
0,"Despite notable risk factors at T1 (low socioeconomic status and education, high stress, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and dysfunctional attitudes) and a substantial increase in general psychopathology at T2, the individual already exhibited marked psychological difficulties at T1 (very high stress, very low coping, high dysfunctional attitudes, poor mental health and self-efficacy). Thus, the pattern suggests ongoing or persistent psychological problems rather than the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although there is a decrease in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction), the individual started with strong protective factors at T1 (notably high social support and low dysfunctional attitudes), had low general psychopathology at baseline, and showed further reductions in key risk factors (anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations), as well as no rise in psychopathology symptoms. These patterns do not indicate the development of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Although the individual had significant risk factors at T1 (very high stress, high general psychopathology, above-average anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations, alongside low socioeconomic status), these issues were already present at baseline and improved by T2 (general psychopathology decreased substantially, as did anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, while life satisfaction increased). There is no evidence of the development of a new disorder between T1 and T2—rather, the data suggest ongoing or improving conditions."
0,"The individual showed already elevated risk factors at T1 (high anxiety sensitivity, high fear of bodily sensations, very low life satisfaction), but did not have significant psychopathology at baseline. Despite increased dysfunctional attitudes and some rise in general psychopathology by T2, their baseline was already suggestive of ongoing vulnerability rather than the development of a completely new disorder, and there is insufficient evidence in the data for a clear onset of a new psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"Despite the presence of lower education and socioeconomic status (demographic risk factors) and a dramatic drop in self-efficacy and increase in anxiety sensitivity, protective factors at T1—including high social support, high life satisfaction, and low initial psychopathology—along with small or negative changes in general psychopathology and stable dysfunctional attitudes, suggest no clear evidence of new disorder onset between T1 and T2."
0,"Although the individual started with elevated risk factors at T1 (notably high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, stress, and general psychopathology), by T2 there were significant improvements: strong increases in protective factors (positive mental health, social support, life satisfaction) and a large reduction in general psychopathology. These positive changes indicate recovery or resilience rather than the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with high social support, low stress, low general psychopathology, and low risk factors at T1, and despite small decreases in self-efficacy and life satisfaction and slight increases in dysfunctional attitudes and fear of bodily sensations, overall changes are mild, and no strong evidence suggests the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite demographic risk factors (lower education and SES, higher BMI), the person was psychologically healthy at T1 with high self-efficacy, low psychopathology, and strong coping resources. No major risk factors sharply increased from T1 to T2—positive mental health actually improved, and GSI remained low—so there is no evidence for new disorder development."
0,"Although the individual had some initial risk factors at T1 (high stress, low self-efficacy, low life satisfaction, and negative socioeconomic status), their psychological risk factors mostly decreased or improved between T1 and T2 (notable increases in social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, with declines in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and stable GSI), indicating a reduced likelihood of developing a psychological disorder."
0,"Although the person started with relatively low positive mental health and life satisfaction at T1, they had high socioeconomic status and education as protective factors, and from T1 to T2, all key protective factors improved (increases in positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) while risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes) decreased; the minimal increase in general psychopathology is small and does not outweigh these gains, making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Although there is a large drop in self-efficacy and an increase in dysfunctional attitudes, the person experienced an increase in social support, decreases in anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations, and a substantial decrease in general psychopathology (GSI) between T1 and T2, all of which are strong protective changes that suggest no new psychological disorder developed."
0,"Although the person had several risk factors at T1 (low positive mental health, low social support, high stress, low life satisfaction), all major mental health indicators—including positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction—improved by T2, and general psychopathology significantly decreased, suggesting recovery rather than the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The person exhibits strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, low distress, and low dysfunctional attitudes), and although some protective factors such as social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction decrease by T2, risk factors and general psychopathology do not show a meaningful increase, so there is no clear evidence of new disorder development."
0,"The person started with some mildly elevated distress and low positive mental health, but showed improvements over time in several protective factors—including increased positive mental health, social support, and life satisfaction—with no significant increase in general psychopathology or key risk factors. There is no evidence of new onset of psychological disorder between T1 and T2."
0,"The person started with some psychological risk (high anxiety sensitivity and moderately elevated dysfunctional attitudes/GSI), but at T2, most risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, GSI, dysfunctional attitudes) decreased notably, and no new significant risk factors arose—protective factors also remained reasonably stable—indicating no new disorder developed."
0,"Despite some initial risk factors at T1 (elevated stress, low life satisfaction), this individual showed marked improvements in protective factors between T1 and T2 (substantial increases in positive mental health, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, alongside decreases in anxiety sensitivity and general psychopathology), indicating a greatly reduced likelihood of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) and significant declines in protective factors (self-efficacy, life satisfaction), the individual had extremely high general psychopathology (GSI) at T1 and showed a marked decrease in GSI at T2, indicating ongoing recovery from a disorder rather than development of a new one between T1 and T2."
0,"This person had significant psychopathology (GSI) and anxiety sensitivity already at T1, indicating existing mental health issues rather than later onset; although dysfunctional attitudes and fear increased, overall psychological distress sharply decreased at T2, suggesting no emergence of a new disorder but rather improvement."
0,"Despite high stress and psychopathology at T1, the individual showed substantial improvements between T1 and T2 in most protective factors (social support, self-efficacy, life satisfaction) and a dramatic reduction in psychopathology (GSI), indicating recovery rather than the development of a new disorder."
0,"Despite decreased positive mental health and life satisfaction, this individual had high protective demographic factors (education, socioeconomic status), low baseline psychopathology, and improvements or stability in other risk factors (decreased anxiety sensitivity, stable or decreased GSI, increased self-efficacy), making new disorder development unlikely."
0,"Although there is a large drop in positive mental health and self-efficacy, initial high self-efficacy, low psychopathology at T1, a major decrease in dysfunctional attitudes, and a strong increase in life satisfaction all function as key protective factors. Despite increased general psychopathology, the overall profile—including rising life satisfaction and decreasing dysfunctional attitudes—suggests continued resilience rather than new disorder onset."
0,"The individual had some risk factors at T1 (low education, low positive mental health, elevated anxiety sensitivity and high fear of bodily sensations), but also strong protective factors (high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, social support, low stress and GSI). Between T1 and T2, there are only minor worsening trends (slight increases in anxiety sensitivity and GSI with mild drops in protective factors), but the changes are modest and not indicative of new disorder onset. Thus, there is no strong evidence for the development of a new psychological disorder."
1,"Although the person started with very strong protective factors at T1 (high self-efficacy, social support, and life satisfaction, low stress and psychopathology, low risk attitudes and sensitivity), by T2 they experienced large increases in risk factors (anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes, general psychopathology) and marked declines in protective factors (especially self-efficacy and life satisfaction), strongly indicating the onset of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although the individual started with below-average positive mental health, self-efficacy, and social support at T1 (risk factors), these were accompanied by strong protective demographic factors (high education and socioeconomic status), low baseline psychopathology, and substantial improvements across nearly all protective variables (especially social support, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy) between T1 and T2; there is no meaningful increase in general psychopathology, so the data do not suggest the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite a moderate increase in general psychopathology, this individual’s risk factors (like anxiety sensitivity and fear of bodily sensations) and dysfunctional attitudes decreased notably between T1 and T2, and strong protective factors (problem-/emotion-focused coping, self-efficacy at T1) provide substantial resilience; there is no pattern indicative of developing a new psychological disorder."
0,"Despite some demographic risk factors (low socioeconomic status and BMI), the individual had below-average mental health, social support, and life satisfaction at T1, but showed substantial improvements across virtually all protective factors (increased positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction) and reductions in risk factors (lower anxiety sensitivity, dysfunctional attitudes) between T1 and T2; these changes indicate recovery or resilience rather than new disorder development."
1,"The individual began with multiple risk factors at T1, including low education, high BMI, low socioeconomic status, low positive mental health and life satisfaction, and mildly elevated stress. By T2, there is a substantial drop in social support, further decline in positive mental health, and a large increase in general psychopathology (GSI), all of which point to the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"Although there is a substantial increase in general psychopathology (GSI) from T1 to T2, this person started with several risk factors (low positive mental health/self-efficacy/life satisfaction, high anxiety sensitivity/fear) but also high social support and no indication of a disorder at baseline; by T2, protective factors (positive mental health, life satisfaction) have improved greatly, suggesting overall functioning has not deteriorated enough to support new-onset disorder, even with the rise in distress."
0,"Despite initially elevated risk factors at T1 (high anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, and general psychopathology), this person shows strong protective demographic factors (high education, SES, BMI), and there are substantial improvements in protective psychological variables between T1 and T2 (notably increases in self-efficacy, social support, life satisfaction, and a reduction in general psychopathology and fear), indicating recovery or resilience rather than development of a new disorder."
0,"Although the individual started with significant psychological distress and risk factors at T1 (very high GSI, anxiety sensitivity, stress, and low socioeconomic status), their mental health markedly improved from T1 to T2 (large increases in positive mental health and decreases in GSI, anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations), with no evidence for the development of a new disorder—rather, this pattern suggests substantial recovery."
1,"Despite strong protective demographic factors (high education, BMI, and socioeconomic status), this individual started with several psychological risk factors at T1 (low self-efficacy, low positive mental health, high anxiety sensitivity, and fear of bodily sensations) and experienced marked increases in key risk variables between T1 and T2, including sharp rises in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, and general psychopathology (GSI). The significant increase in these risk indicators, especially GSI, strongly suggests the onset of a new psychological disorder by T2."
0,"The person started T1 with some risk factors, such as lower positive mental health and higher stress, but protective factors like strong social support, high self-efficacy, life satisfaction, very low dysfunctional attitudes, and low general psychopathology. Although there is a moderate increase in psychopathology from T1 to T2 and a decline in several protective factors (self-efficacy, positive mental health, life satisfaction), the initial mental health status was quite strong and there is no evidence of sufficiently severe deterioration or emergence of clear risk patterns to indicate the development of a new psychological disorder."
0,"The individual started with some vulnerability (lower positive mental health, elevated dysfunctional attitudes), but also with protective factors (low stress, decent self-efficacy, above-average life satisfaction, low general psychopathology). Over time, there was no notable rise in risk factors or psychopathology; most protective factors declined slightly, but general psychopathology actually decreased, making the emergence of a new disorder unlikely."
0,"Although this individual started with elevated coping, positive mental health, and social support, they already had above-average general psychopathology (GSI) at T1, suggesting an existing disorder rather than new-onset pathology. Despite severe declines in protective factors (social support, life satisfaction, self-efficacy) and increased dysfunctional attitudes, the presence of an already high GSI at T1 indicates that a new psychological disorder likely did not develop between T1 and T2."
0,"The individual showed below-average positive mental health, social support, and high dysfunctional attitudes at T1, but also low general psychopathology, good life satisfaction, and average risk factors. From T1 to T2, key protective factors (positive mental health, social support, self-efficacy) improved, and risk factors (dysfunctional attitudes, GSI) significantly decreased, suggesting a lower risk of developing a new psychological disorder."
1,"While the person started with generally low risk (low anxiety sensitivity, fear, and dysfunctional attitudes, plus good self-efficacy), there were dramatic increases in nearly all risk factors by T2—including large rises in anxiety sensitivity, fear of bodily sensations, dysfunctional attitudes, overall psychopathology, and a sharp drop in social support—indicating the development of a new psychological disorder."
