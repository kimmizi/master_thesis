Be thorough in your consideration of the variables and their relationships. In your assessment: \\n 1. Categorize variables into risk factors and protective factors. \\n 2. Consider the severity and direction of changes between T1 and T2. \\n 3. Evaluate the overall trend (improving or worsening) based on the changes. \\n 4. Consider potential interactions between variables. \\n \\n  After your assessment, provide your prediction as either YES or NO, followed by a brief explanation (no more than two sentences) supporting your decision. \\n Example output format: \\n Prediction: [YES/NO] \\n Explanation: [Brief explanation supporting your prediction] \\n \\n Remember, your goal is to make the most accurate prediction possible based on the given information. Your final output should consist only of the prediction and brief explanation, without duplicating or rehashing any of the work you did in the psychological assessment.'"
